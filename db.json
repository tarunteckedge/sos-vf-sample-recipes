Your favorite plant-based toppings from mushrooms and peppers to vegan �pepperoni� or �ham!� It�s especially popular with kids, because pizza can be picked up and eaten with fingers and hands. Not surprisingly, an international poll rated pizza as one of the top three favorite foods in the world.<\/p><p>Since finding awesome ways to celebrate defines both Veggie Fest and our fans, let�s talk pizza AND a party!<\/p><p>First steps to planning a fun night is to identify your crowd. Are you planning for your immediate household or extended family? Are you inviting neighbors or old friends? Once you�ve decided on your audience, go little or go big. Any pizza party involves three things: making pizza, playing games, and having fun. Even in your pajamas!<\/p><p>Getting your kids to participate from the get-go is essential. With a little prep work, even young kids can assemble a pizza, wait for it to bake, and . . eat!<\/p><p>Decide first whether you want to go all-out by making dough and the marinara sauce from scratch. If so, we�ve got you covered.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/marinara-sauce/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27545\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Marinara-Sauce-W\" width=\"1100\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>If it�s a Friday night after work, you can also simplify by using a pre-made crust or dough, English muffins, naan, French or Italian bread.<\/p><p>Arranging the ingredients before your kids�or guests�arrive, guarantees a seamless celebration. Make your dough and sauce ahead of time or set out your prepared �crusts.� Chop the veggies and arrange in separate containers along with your toppings and cheeses (vegan or dairy). Set your ingredients in the middle of a large table, and leave the perimeter for your pizza-making chefs. Add a bit of pizazz by changing the atmosphere with music. The best part of a pizza party is the conversation and community you�re creating in your kitchen. You don�t have to over plan, either. Make sure you�re relaxed and participating, too. All hands on deck!<\/p><p><strong>Homemade Pizza Dough<\/strong><\/p><p>There is nothing better than a made-from-scratch pizza. Homemade dough and marinara sauce bring your meal to a whole new level. It tastes so much better than store-bought. All it takes is a bit of practice . . .<\/p><p>When using freshly made dough for your pizza party, you can prepare it ahead of time and refrigerate. Make the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes, cover, and refrigerate. About 2-3 hours before you are ready to assemble your pizzas, remove the dough and let it sit, covered, on your counter. Just before your guests arrive, divide the dough into balls about the size of a fist. Cover and let rest.<\/p><p>When ready to assemble the pizzas, let the children shape their own crusts and place them on the oiled or parchment-lined baking sheets. They may have as much fun with the shapes they create as with the toppings they choose. Once shaped, crimp or fold the edges. Follow the directions in the recipe for assembling and baking.<\/p><p>Try our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/traditional-new-york-style-pizza-crust/\">traditional pizza crust<\/a> or our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/whole-wheat-pizza-crust/\">Whole Wheat Pizza Crust<\/a>. <\/p><p><strong>English Muffin Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If you choose English muffins for your base, buy enough so each guest can have one whole muffin (and maybe another for seconds). Shortly before your guests arrive, split the muffins and place them on a parchment-lined sheet. Bake in a 400�F (204�C) for 3 minutes to crisp. After removing from the oven, cover the breads until you are ready to make your pizzas.<\/p><p>Assembly is easy. Top the muffins with sauce, mozzarella cheese (vegan or dairy), and assorted toppings. Return muffins to the baking sheet and place in a 400�F (204�C) oven for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted, and the muffins are slightly brown on the edges.<\/p><p>TIP: If you have leftover baked pizzas, you can freeze them on a baking sheet first, and once they�re frozen, store in the freezer until you�re ready to use. For a snack or quick meal, place the frozen English muffin pizzas on a parchment-lined sheet, and bake in a 350�F (191�C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until cheese is melted and bread is warm.<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28872\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Prep\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>French or Italian Bread Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If using French or Italian breads, buy a good quality bread as this will make or break your pizza. Depending on the size of your bread, you should be able to get 4-6 �slices� out of each half. Find a bread that has a soft rather than crispy crust.<\/p><p>Slice the bread in half, length-wise, and store in a bag until ready to use. Each half will become a �team pizza.� This works great with older children who are more adventurous and apt to try new taste combinations and negotiate their pizza experience. Working together also makes the pizza taste better!<\/p><p>Sub sandwich buns also work great as pizza crusts. One per guest should be sufficient, and for children you can start with a half sub each.<\/p><p>Before assembly starts, preheat your oven to 400�F (204�C).<\/p><p>Unlike the English muffins, you don�t have to crisp the crust first. On each half of your bread or bun, spread marinara or pizza sauce. Add toppings and cheese. On the middle rack of your oven, bake the pizza for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the sides of the bread are lightly browned.<\/p><p>Remove from oven. Allow to cool slightly before slicing (if using a whole loaf rather than a bun).<\/p><p><strong>Other Food Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>If your party guests are children, they probably won�t need an elaborate table of foods to choose from. Consider a simple tossed salad, a plate of antipasto (veg of course!), and a bowl of fruit. For dessert, we suggest sorbet, ice cream, or Nice cream.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/nice-cream/).\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27731\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg\" alt=\"Nice-Cream\" width=\"1100\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-300x182.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-768x465.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>Ice cream is a natural pairing to pizza. If you want to continue the do-it-yourself theme, set out a few toppings, from chocolate to sprinkles to fresh fruit.<\/p><p><strong>Party Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>To decorate for your party, remember that Italy�s colors are red, white, and green. You can color small Italian flags or purchase at a party store. Create your own pizzeria by topping your tables with red and white checkered tablecloths�choose vinyl, if you can find them, for easy cleanup. If you can�t find vinyl, check your local fabric store for gingham fabric (usually inexpensive) and select checks that are large.<\/p><p>If you�re going all out, you can add pictures on your wall from Italy like the Leaning Tower of Pizza (oops! Pisa), the Colosseum, canals of Venice, a map of Italy, etc. Hang red, white, and green streamers and dangle a few balloons.<\/p><p>For your guests old and young, have a stack of blank paper or Mona Lisa coloring sheets (easy to print from the Internet) and ask your partiers to create their own contemporary Mona Lisa. What would a Mona Lisa today look like? Would she be a sports fan? a scientist? a musician? a chef?<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28873\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Party\" width=\"1200\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-300x154.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-768x395.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>Games and Movies<\/strong><\/p><p>Movies and pizza seem to go together. A lot of famous movies are set in Italy, but most of them are for older children or adults. However, there are classics that everyone likes: Disney�s Pinocchio, Lady and the Tramp (for the best pasta scene ever), or go rogue and watch the French-inspired Ratatouille (for chefs of all ages). After your meal has finished and the games have been played, pop in a movie while you�re cleaning up.<\/p><p>Some other choices for the older children or adults could be Letters to Juliet, Enchanted April, or a true classic, Roman Holiday. You could even stream an Italian opera like the fun, happily-ever-after ending, Barber of Seville.<\/p><p>If you�d rather play games, here are some fun, inexpensive party games that should appeal.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3\">https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606\">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/\">https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Fun Pizza Facts<\/strong><\/p><p>(Courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/\">https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/<\/a>)<\/p><ul><li>The first pizza is thought to have been invented in Naples in the early 1500s.<\/li><li>The first documented pizzeria was opened in Naples in the late 1800s.<br />The first pizzeria, Lombardi�s, opened in the United States in New York city in 1905.<\/li><li>Pizza in the US didn�t become popular until after World War II when soldiers stationed in Italy developed a taste for the popular dish and started opening up restaurants back home.<\/li><li>NASA funded and tested a 3D printer that can make pizza for astronauts in space.<\/li><li>3 billion pizzas are sold in the US each year.<\/li><li>In the US, October is National Pizza month!<\/li><\/ul><p>&#8211;by Mary Pomerantz for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">Mary Pomerantz lives in the Chicago area with her husband of fifty years.

There was always a full cookie jar<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and baked goods of every sort. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meals were simple but often filled with fat. Vegetables, when served, were usually tasteless and out of a can. I loved her cooking, but because of it, I was a chubby child and an overweight teenager. Before I graduated from high school, I was able to trim down. This gave me more energy and self-confidence. Later in life, I learned how to cook delicious foods without the fat content associated with �good home<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> cooking.�<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Years later, when I discovered a whole food, plant-based diet�and a way of cooking without oil�I�ve been able to control my weight successfully while also increasing my health and stamina. In this blog, I�m going to provide tips for oil-free baking, roasting, saut�ing, and flavoring. It�s easier than you think, and once you learn these tips, you will be able to make your favorite recipes and reduce the fat content substantially. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The reason for reducing oil in our diet has everything to do with health. Linda Scotti is a nurse and educator with an expertise in nutrition. She�s also a regular blogger and member of the Veggie Fest team who will explain the science behind this cooking and health strategy. She says,<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Oil is a processed food. All oils, including olive oil, are extremely low in nutritive value. All the nutrients�including protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water�have been stripped away. Oil is nothing but fat � empty calories. It has more calories per gram than any other food. One tablespoon of oil contains 120 pure fat calories. Since oil has no fat-binding fibers, it�s absorbed rapidly and stored away as body fat within minutes. Several scientific studies have demonstrated that oil is harmful to the endothelium (the innermost lining of the arteries) and that injury is the gateway to vascular disease. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/h5><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn has demonstrated that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent and stop the progression of heart disease, but also reverse its effects. In his book, <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">, Dr. Esselstyn documents his 20-year nutritional study with scientific evidence. Esselstyn is quick to point out that scientific evidence indicates consumption of processed oils (whether monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, or saturated) contribute to obesity and diabetes, increased triglycerides, endothelial dysfunction/impairment and atherosclerotic lesions.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Robert Vogel at the University of Maryland reported in the <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Journal of the American College of Cardiology<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> that olive oil was found to reduce flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by 31% after consumption. Flow-mediated dilation is a non-invasive vascular test which measures blood vessel health. The endothelium releases vasodilators, including nitric oxide, which cause dilation in healthy arteries and keep the blood flowing smoothly. A decrease <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">in FMD is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. In simple terms, the olive oil may impair your arteries ability to relax and dilate normally.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cooking and Baking Without Oils<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are used to adding oil and fats in your cooking and baking, you might think nothing will taste good without it. While your baked product will definitely taste different, it can still be tasty. It took me a lot of years and a lot of reading to uncover the tricks for making food cooked without oil to be just as delicious. I hope you will use these tips to try cooking and baking without oil in your home.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/oatmeal-muffins-with-variations/\">Oatmeal Muffins<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This muffin recipe uses pureed, crushed, or mashed fruit to replace the oil and add sweetness.

Start with a good quality non-stick skillet. Prep your vegetables and then preheat your skillet on a medium high heat. When your pan is hot, add the onions. You need to watch as they cook, but you don�t need to stir constantly. After a few seconds, the vegetables will release moisture. After a few more seconds, they will start to brown. This is the step where the onions need to be carefully watched to prevent them from overbrowning. At some point, if they start to stick to the pan, just add a tablespoon of veggie broth or water and stir it around. After about a minute and a half, turn the onions down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often. If they start to stick, add a little more liquid. Cook until they reach a nice caramelized state.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are adding mushrooms, after about two minutes of cooking the onions, add the mushrooms to the skillet. They release even more moisture so that you may not need to add any extra liquid. Continue to cook at the higher heat until the mushrooms begin to brown. At this point, turn the heat down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often, adding a little liquid as needed. Sometimes, the mushrooms release more moisture than you want in your recipe. No problem, just take the lid off and turn the heat back up to medium high. Stir until all the moisture has evaporated.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You will be happy with this method of saut�ing vegetables. It works for more than just onions and mushrooms. You can use this technique to make a dish of saut�ed cabbage or pan roasted Brussels sprouts or even asparagus. The trick is to start with a hot, dry skillet and stir until your vegetables just start to brown. This releases the sugars in the vegetables and adds so much flavor to whatever recipe you are making.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roasting Vegetables<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes, you will want to roast vegetables like Brussels sprouts or root vegetables. You can still leave off the oil with good results. For dense vegetables like potatoes, it helps to parboil them before you roast them. For instance, when I make oven fries, I cut them in the shape I want, cover them with water and bring the pot to a boil. As soon as the water boils, I turn the heat off, drain the potatoes and put them in the oven on a baking sheet or roasting pan lined with parchment paper to keep the vegetables from sticking.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another tip that helps get a nice crisp to a vegetable is to use a parchment lined pizza pan with holes in it. Cook the vegetables for half the time that you normally would, remove the parchment paper and leave the vegetables on the pan. The holes help to give the vegetables a nice crisp finish. Start out at a moderate temperature, 350�F, and during the last two or three minutes, turn up the oven to 450�F to finish to the crisp stage. Check the vegetables slightly before the time when you think they might be done. The cooking time may be reduced if you use this type of pan.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\">Lentil Millet Sweet Potato Plant-based Burger<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-24734\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg\" alt=\"Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-768x433.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/a><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Judicious Use of Flavorings<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When you are eliminating oil from your diet and possibly even eliminating or at least reducing your sodium intake, you have to add flavorings to your recipes to fool your taste buds into not missing the fat and sodium they are used to. There are two things that help you do this. One is adding something sweet and the other is adding something tart. Citrus fruit is wonderful because it can add both flavors with one squeeze. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fruit in salad <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often add whole fruits to a salad, for instance, because it really perks up the flavor of the dish. Think pineapple chunks, orange slices, and crisp apple slices. In the summer, you can even grill peaches or nectarines and add them to your salad or add a handful of strawberries or raspberries for that real summertime flavor boost.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Steaming vegetables <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here�s how I prepare most side dishes of vegetables so that I never miss the butter or oil. I start by steaming either fresh, raw vegetables or a bag of quality frozen vegetables. You need to learn the correct times for steaming and with a little and trial and error, you will become a pro. Start with a pan of boiling water, about 2 inches in depth. Once the water is boiling, add the vegetables to a steamer basket and place it over the pan. If the vegetables are fresh, they will only probably only take 1-3 minutes to become tender. If they are frozen, the time is about doubled or a little more. Just watch them to ensure they don�t overcook because you can end up with mushy vegetables rather quickly.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once the vegetables are tender, take the steamer basket out, and set it on a hot pad or trivet. To the warm pan over medium heat, add about a tablespoon of low sodium soy or tamari sauce with a teaspoon of minced garlic and about a half tablespoon of a good quality balsamic vinegar. Stir for about a minute to cook the garlic. Add the steamed vegetables, toss and serve. If you don�t want to use the balsamic, you could add a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon to the steamed vegetables and toss it in the warmed soy sauce and garlic mixture. Also, before you toss the vegetables, you can add the herbs of your choice such as basil, tarragon, Italian seasoning, etc.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Balsamic Vinegars <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are many good flavored balsamic vinegars on the market. They can be expensive, but they can really add to the flavor of a meal. I love to go into a balsamic boutique shop <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to sample the flavors. Citrus flavored vinegars add a sweet tart note to salads or vegetables. Chocolate or vanilla vinegars are great over fresh or poached fruit for desserts. Try a few different flavors for an incredible taste treat!<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Citrus <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A squeeze of either an orange or a lemon can perk up many dishes from beans to stir fries. When I started cooking without oil and lower sodium, I started thinking about the flavors that I like and played with different seasonings. Don�t be afraid to try something. Just remember that with some flavors, a little goes a long way. Try a little seasoning, taste, and adjust by adding a little more until you get the dish just the way you want. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking Without Fat<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking without adding fat is a little trickier. Some recipes seem to have no problems when you substitute other things for the oil or butter. To me it�s always worth a try to experiment with favorite recipes to see what works. I�ve made cookies, cakes, and quick breads that are tasty without the addition of oil. They are usually moister and less fluffy than pastries and breads made with oil, but they are equally as good and a lot healthier. The one pastry that I have never been able to come up with is a traditional pie crust that is usually made with vegetable shortening or butter. If you want a pie, you will have to find recipes that typically use nuts and dates that will hold together and make a suitable base for your pie fillings.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For substitutions in your baking try using <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><ul><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">unsweetened applesauce or mashed bananas to replace oil or butter and <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">prune puree to replace butter. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another substitute you can use to replace oil or butter is ground flax seed.

In terms of health, a whole food, vegan, plant-based diet can significantly reduce the risk of nearly all major chronic illnesses. Additionally, new research has concluded that a vegan diet produces a 42-84 percent lower burden on the environment than the diet recommended by the U.S. government. Lastly, adopting a vegan diet can save more than 30,000,000 cows, 100,000,000 pigs, 500,000 calves, one trillion fish, and many more animals from being slaughtered in just one year.<\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27160\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">Although veganism has increased in popularity over the past few years, there has also been skepticism claiming that a vegan diet is more costly than a meat-based one. Unfortunately, due to an increased demand from vegan consumers, some companies began making and selling dairy-free products at a higher cost than those containing dairy. Because these companies were so successful, many more began doing the same. In no time, these inflated prices became the norm. Thus, giving the impression that the vegan diet was more pricey than other diets.  <\/span><\/p><p>Although, transitioning to a vegan diet can be more costly�at least initially�it doesn�t have to be. When I first turned vegan, I spent a lot of money because I purchased brand items. However, as I became more familiar with what products were vegan, I began cooking more meals from scratch and learned which brands would be long-lasting and nutritious. Through my own transition period, I realized that living on a vegan diet can be less expensive than a meat-based one. Here are some ways I was able to bust the myth.<br /><b><\/b><\/p><h2>How a Vegan Diet can be Inexpensive<\/h2><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">The main components of a vegan diet are grains, legumes, beans, and seeds, which are very affordable. Whole plant foods contain all the essential nutrients your body needs and are also the cheapest foods out there. Transitioning to a vegan diet can include trying many of the superfoods in the market, which can be more expensive, but these pricier foods are not necessary to incorporate in every meal. Creating a balanced, nutritious vegan meal is both affordable and fun. <\/span><\/p><p>Some quick tips when grocery shopping include buying items in bulk�such as flour, grains, nuts/seeds, etc.�because these foods will not spoil quickly. It is also helpful to buy generic brand items rather than name-brand items, as they will satiate your hunger just as easily, but at a cheaper price! Taking some time to explore different grocery stores in your area and comparing prices can be really useful for future grocery trips. Noting down where each item is located and bringing those notes with you each time you go shopping will not only help you save on costs, but also on time.<\/p><p>Time and cost can also be saved by making a grocery list beforehand within your specific budget so that no foods are purchased unnecessarily. Stocking up on whole foods is another way to cut back on costs since a small portion of whole foods can keep you full longer than other sugary or carbohydrate-rich foods taken in larger portions. Buy frozen fruits and vegetables, as they can be cheaper and contain the same, if not higher, nutritional value as fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"> Eat whole grain cereal for breakfast; hummus served with lettuce in whole wheat pita bread for lunch; a vegetable stir-fry with beans, greens, and brown rice for dinner; and a fruit smoothie for a snack or dessert at a grand total of $2.25 for a full day of plant-based meals. Another example of a meal-plan would be to serve for breakfast a tofu scramble and whole-grain flour tortilla; bean tacos for lunch; soup with beans and collards for dinner; and an apple crisp as a snack or for dessert which altogether costs $4.00 total. There are many other meal plans such as these that only cost $4.00 or less a day, saving money in the long run. <\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27158\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-768x438.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><h2>Long-term Savings from a Vegan Diet<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><\/span><\/h2><p>Not only can you count the cost of food when going vegan, but you can also calculate the money saved on doctors� bills. Eating poorly ultimately results in illness whereas eating healthily can keep you out of the doctor�s office. It is easy to get wrapped up in the short-term savings mindset, such as purchasing food that is unwholesome just because it�s a dollar cheaper than a healthier choice. However, spending a few extra dollars at the grocery store or farmer�s market may actually save you thousands of dollars in potential doctors and hospital visits.<\/p><p>Just in case you think I�m exaggerating, take a look at this sobering statistic: In a study done in 1992, the total direct medical costs linked to meat consumption was between 28.6 and 61.4 billion dollars. Direct healthcare costs attributable to meat consumption can be broken down in this way: $2.8 &#8211; 8.5 billion for hypertension, 9.5 billion for heart disease, 16.5 billion for cancer, 14 &#8211; 17 billion for diabetes, 2.4 billion for gallbladder disease, 1.9 billion for obesity-related musculoskeletal disorders, and 5.5 billion for foodborne illness. Not only have these prices increased since 1992, but healthcare costs have inflated, as well.<\/p><p>At first, the standard American diet (SAD)�which involves a lot of fast food, processed food, sugar, and fatty meats�may seem inexpensive when evaluating dairy and meat items side-by-side with vegan substitutes.  However, when considering that animal-based foods are linked to cancer, the cost of the vegan diet seems nominal.<\/p><p>It�s also important to note that animals farmed by the food industry are themselves given hormones to make them larger and more profitable. Ultimately, these hormones enter into the bodies of those who consume the products and by-products. For example, dairy cattle are given hormones to make them produce more milk; other animals are given food filled with pesticides and herbicides. These poisons�that have been stored in the fat and muscles� ultimately find their way into meat, milk and eggs. Mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are commonly found in fish and shellfish, and can negatively affect reproductive and hormone functions in human beings.<\/p><p>A plant-based diet can help avoid all of these toxic chemicals from entering the body. There is another added benefit for substituting a meat or dairy item with a vegan alternative: By substituting beans for meat, your daily fiber consumption increases by twenty grams. This is a signficant way to tackle the possibility of colon cancer.<\/p><p>Overall, transitioning to a vegan diet is an inexpensive choice, both for the short-term and long-term. Not only is veganism helpful for the environment, our health, and protecting animals, but it also cuts down on our time and expenses. More and more people are turning vegan.

She was a year younger than me, which means I was the instigator. I always did love fresh baked cookies! We sat down at the kitchen table and poured over Mom�s cookbook to find a recipe. I can still remember the name of that cookie, chosen (no doubt) by the way the name rolled off of our tongues�snickerdoodle!<\/p><p>For those of you who are not familiar with this cookie,snickerdoodles are crisp, sugary, and redolent with cinnamon. My memories of the event are hazy. After all, it was over fifty years ago! As I recall, we made a nice mess in the kitchen and the cookies were delicious. My mom didn�t mind turning me loose in the kitchen after this success as long as I cleaned up!<\/p><p>I was raised as the oldest daughter in a large family of seven children. My mom had her hands full, and I was expected to help out in the kitchen at a very early age. It was no chore for me because I loved putting meals together. At first, I only helped by fetching ingredients, opening cans, and stirring pots. I gradually learned from my mother, and by the time I was fourteen, I was cooking meals for the family. This is how Istarted a life-long culinary adventure.<\/p><p><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27386\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-768x495.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/span><\/p><p>Over the years, I�ve enjoyed exploring different cuisines. I own many ethnic cookbooks and subscribe to numerous cooking blogs. What studying different techniques and ingredients has taught me is to be creative and fearless�to take chances. It�s freeing to have the confidence to create your own dishes because you realize that you have learned so much from a lifetime of study. My favorite way of cooking is to use lots of herbs and spices. Lately, I�ve been on an Italian kick which means using a lot of Italian seasoning, garlic, and basil.<\/p><p>Children love cooking with their mom or dad�whoever is the chef in the family. Just as I learned at an early age, I also taught all of my children, and to this day they are all wonderful�if different�kinds of cooks. My son, Brian, who lives in Idaho, ishis family�s main chef. He has three sons. Frey, who is fourteen, has also caught the cooking bug. When my husband and I visited them recently, Frey made a few of the meals and did an excellent job. I was amazed watching him wield a knife to cut up assorted vegetables to make a Thai inspired skillet meal. He even made a coconut/peanut sauce to go with the vegetables and tofu. It was delicious! I expect great things from him in the future.<\/p><p>While Brian excels at simple, mostly one-pot meals, my son Chris, who lives in California, is the gourmet chef in the family. Because he lives in the San Francisco Bay area and has a myriad of vegan restaurants to choose from, his tastes lean more to the exotic. Often when he cooks at home, he likes to make sophisticated recipes like cr�pes with homemade hazelnut butter, vegan cream fillings, all topped with strawberries and drizzled chocolate. He also created a vegan Pad Thai that is as good as any dish I�ve eaten in a restaurant.<\/p><p>My daughter was a comfort food cook. She loved making spaghetti, lasagna, and enchiladas for her family. She also loved carrying on the family traditions that she learned while growing up. For instance, at Christmas time, I liked to cook for days before the actual holiday so that I could rest and enjoy my family instead of spending my time working in the kitchen. I always set up a feast of finger foods and dips in the early afternoon, and we enjoyed it for the rest of the day. I know she instilled this tradition in her children because her son, Max, called me this last Christmas asking for my cheese ball and rolled sugar cookie recipes. My daughter is no longer with us, but the family tradition continues on with the love of cooking that she instilled in her son!<\/p><p><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27387\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/span><\/p><h2>Getting started<\/h2><p>Begin with simple tasks and move gradually onto more complicated ones as your children gain confidence and their skills mature.<\/p><ul><li>When your children are very young, start them out by washing vegetables or fruit at the sink. Fill the sink with water, give them a soft brush, and let them work away. Even if you plan to peel the produce, it still needs to be washed prior to peeling.<br />\nAnother job they can do is place ingredients into a bowl. You measure, they dump. Just make sure you are using a big, wide bowl to lessen chances of spillage.<\/li><li>Once your children reach seven or eight years, they should be able to open cans for you and empty the cans into a pot or bowl. You can supervise the process, but allow them to do the work. Once the ingredients are in the bowl or the pot, they can stir them together.<\/li><li>When they are older, they can even stir a pot on the stove. Place a stepstool up to the stove, and place the heat on a low flame. Of course, a lesson about the dangers of hot burners and boiling pots can precede the cooking time. If a child knows that you trust them to be careful, they will want to do a good job for you.<\/li><\/ul><h2><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Creative Cookies<\/span><\/span><\/h2><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/cutout-sugar-cookies-for-the-holidays/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26001\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-1024x586.jpg\" alt=\"Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-300x172.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-768x439.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>There are many recipes you and your children can make together that give them more scope and creativity.

Let them have a hand in selecting the recipe and even shopping for the ingredients. The more independence we teach our children, the better prepared they are to face life on their own. If they know that you trust them, it will bring them great joy. Like Maria Montessori has said :<\/p><p class=\"s10\"><em>�Joy, feeling one&#8217;s own value, being appreciated and loved by others, feeling useful and capable of production are all factors of enormous value for the human soul.�<\/em><\/p><p>Most important, bringing kids into the kitchen is a way for everyone to have fun!<\/p><p>Cooking does not have to be a chore. Instead, it can be a highly satisfying and enjoyable activity.<\/p><p>Because the Veggie Fest team is convinced there is a budding chef in most kids, we will make this topic a recurring theme in blogs to come. We hope you enjoy them!<\/p><p><em>Mary Pomerantz lives in the Chicago area with her husband of fifty years. Together, they have been vegetarian since 1969 and raised their three children as vegetarians. Mary has always been a foodie and enjoys cooking, researching recipes, and reading cookbooks and food blogs. She has been involved with Veggie Fest since its inception, with over 11 years coordinating the food demos.<\/em><\/p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/kids-in-the-kitchen/\">Why Cooking with Your Kids is a Good Idea<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org\">Veggie Fest<\/a>.<\/p>"

      "encoded": "<p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">It�s still deep winter in Northern Michigan as I am writing this. An expanse of white stretches outside, punctuated by dozens of blue jays that swoop down to pick up sunflower seeds and peanuts from the feeders, outlining blue and white feather arabesques as they fly away. And I dream of spring.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">I bring out the old metal box with my seeds from last year: the ones that were left over and the ones I preserved myself. I still have many seeds, and I am making mental lists of what seeds to order from the glossy seed catalogs that arrive in the mail. Their pictures of beautiful vegetables and fruits, herbs and leaves present a subliminal message, enticing me to put this and that variety on my shopping list.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">It�s still too early to start most seedlings in pots in my sunroom, but in a few weeks, I will start several varieties of peppers and eggplant. When I return from my trip to India in late March, I will start the tomatoes and the brassica family. That will also be the time to clean the little old greenhouse from the walnut-hull debris that the squirrels have left behind. I will start using it in April to help harden the seedlings that will have sprouted by then. That�s the time I will also start cucumbers and my annual flowers: marigolds, zinnia, and calendula, right in the greenhouse. And then, 25 garden beds will need to be turned over and \\ covered with compost. I will consult last year�s map of the garden and chart this year�s planting. By the time May comes around, the greenhouse will be bursting with plants to be transplanted in the garden beds.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><\/p><h2>GETTING READY FOR THE SPRING GARDEN<\/h2><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> If this is the first time you are planning a garden, it�s good to start early and to start small. The steps below will give you an understanding of what a garden plot involves, but you do not have to follow them implicitly. You can skip several steps and even buy plants ready to be put in the soil in May or June, but starting seeds yourself is part of the fun.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> February: Decide what you would like to plant this year. Make an outline on paper of your garden spot and figure out what will go where. If you are ambitious and you want to give your plants a little boost, study companion planting for more successful gardening. Some plants love to cozy up to each other, while others might emit substances that are not beneficial to their neighbors. A good old book to consult is Carrots Love Tomatoes, by Louise Riotte. Borrow it from your library and go directly to the chart at the end listing which plants like each other.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">At this stage, it might be a pleasure to dream about five varieties of tomato plants, but try to be realistic. See what would grow well in your area, in your soil, in your garden plot. Most varieties of plants can grow in northern climates�either in the spring or in the fall. Consult the seed companies� catalogs and make a list of seeds to order. Try to find companies that are located in your hardiness zone; this will make sure your plants will thrive in your climate.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>March<\/strong>: Once you have a good idea of what you will plant, and you have your seeds in hand, find out how many days it takes for your specific varieties to be ready for harvest. Then, start your seeds accordingly. For example, eggplant needs a long growing season. In northern Michigan, we have a shorter season for their liking, so I have to start the seeds in early March. The same thing holds true for peppers. Since pepper seeds take a long time to germinate (2-3 weeks) I start them at the same time as the eggplant.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In my sunroom, I bring in an old rickety table just for the seedlings. I cover it with a plastic sheet and put my seed trays and individual pots right on the plastic.  After filling the containers with organic composted earth, I seed the pots, water them and cover with a thin layer of clear plastic to keep the moisture in. That way, I do not need to water every day. As soon as the little heads start popping out, I remove the clear plastic cover. If your windows are not true south-facing, you might want to invest in some growing lights or simple heat lamps. You can find them online or in feed stores. They will maintain an even heat/light for these sensitive seedlings.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>April<\/strong>: This is the time to start other plants that need a long season: tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, okra, basil. They get the same treatment that the eggplant and peppers did. Just remember that basil is very cold sensitive. Make sure it is always in a warm, sunny place. If you have a greenhouse or some cold frames, get them ready so that you may install your seedlings there, as the temperatures get warmer. The brassica family plants are the first to get into the greenhouse, as they are hardier than the other plants. I start the annual flowers and the cucumbers right in the greenhouse, but I still baby the basil and keep it in the house.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">As soon as all the snow is gone, and I can turn over the earth in the garden beds, I plant lettuce, carrots, spinach, parsley, swiss chard, collards, and other plants that like the cold soil.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">By now, the garlic that I planted in one bed in October has popped up and it is the first green in the garden. I use the first fronds to spice up my cooking.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>May<\/strong>: By now, you can start to fill the greenhouse with any vegetable that needs a little extra time. If you do not have a greenhouse, you can take your plants outside on the deck to harden them. You can always bring them back in if the weather turns unexpectedly cold. Depending in which zone you live, you might start transplanting your plants directly in the soil. I usually do not take any chances and finish the garden in June.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>June<\/strong>: As the weather warms up, the greenhouse is full of plants eager to be out in their permanent home. It takes a few days to empty the greenhouse, so I start with the hardiest ones and then continue with the ones that love warmth the most. I try to finish most of the garden by the first week of June, except for one or two beds that I leave empty for successive planting. I wait a few weeks between seeding several varieties of lettuce, carrots, and spinach, and they get in the ground in June and July. That way I have lettuce and a variety of greens throughout the summer.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG4-1024x419.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"419\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">And the season will change into full summer, with the garden greening, ripening, producing, and offering its magic: dirt under the fingernails; color in the garden; greens on our plates; a palette of tastes in our cooking, and a deep satisfaction that comes from enjoying the growing foods that the garden yields.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> Well, I am ahead of myself. All this is about to unfold in the coming months. Right now, I am going outside to replenish the bird feeders.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">&#8212; Lizzie Treefon for the Veggie Fest Team<br /><em>Lizzie Treefon arrived in the USA from her native Greece more than 40 years ago.
