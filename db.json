Your favorite plant-based toppings from mushrooms and peppers to vegan �pepperoni� or �ham!� It�s especially popular with kids, because pizza can be picked up and eaten with fingers and hands. Not surprisingly, an international poll rated pizza as one of the top three favorite foods in the world.<\/p><p>Since finding awesome ways to celebrate defines both Veggie Fest and our fans, let�s talk pizza AND a party!<\/p><p>First steps to planning a fun night is to identify your crowd. Are you planning for your immediate household or extended family? Are you inviting neighbors or old friends? Once you�ve decided on your audience, go little or go big. Any pizza party involves three things: making pizza, playing games, and having fun. Even in your pajamas!<\/p><p>Getting your kids to participate from the get-go is essential. With a little prep work, even young kids can assemble a pizza, wait for it to bake, and . . eat!<\/p><p>Decide first whether you want to go all-out by making dough and the marinara sauce from scratch. If so, we�ve got you covered.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/marinara-sauce/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27545\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Marinara-Sauce-W\" width=\"1100\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>If it�s a Friday night after work, you can also simplify by using a pre-made crust or dough, English muffins, naan, French or Italian bread.<\/p><p>Arranging the ingredients before your kids�or guests�arrive, guarantees a seamless celebration. Make your dough and sauce ahead of time or set out your prepared �crusts.� Chop the veggies and arrange in separate containers along with your toppings and cheeses (vegan or dairy). Set your ingredients in the middle of a large table, and leave the perimeter for your pizza-making chefs. Add a bit of pizazz by changing the atmosphere with music. The best part of a pizza party is the conversation and community you�re creating in your kitchen. You don�t have to over plan, either. Make sure you�re relaxed and participating, too. All hands on deck!<\/p><p><strong>Homemade Pizza Dough<\/strong><\/p><p>There is nothing better than a made-from-scratch pizza. Homemade dough and marinara sauce bring your meal to a whole new level. It tastes so much better than store-bought. All it takes is a bit of practice . . .<\/p><p>When using freshly made dough for your pizza party, you can prepare it ahead of time and refrigerate. Make the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes, cover, and refrigerate. About 2-3 hours before you are ready to assemble your pizzas, remove the dough and let it sit, covered, on your counter. Just before your guests arrive, divide the dough into balls about the size of a fist. Cover and let rest.<\/p><p>When ready to assemble the pizzas, let the children shape their own crusts and place them on the oiled or parchment-lined baking sheets. They may have as much fun with the shapes they create as with the toppings they choose. Once shaped, crimp or fold the edges. Follow the directions in the recipe for assembling and baking.<\/p><p>Try our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/traditional-new-york-style-pizza-crust/\">traditional pizza crust<\/a> or our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/whole-wheat-pizza-crust/\">Whole Wheat Pizza Crust<\/a>. <\/p><p><strong>English Muffin Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If you choose English muffins for your base, buy enough so each guest can have one whole muffin (and maybe another for seconds). Shortly before your guests arrive, split the muffins and place them on a parchment-lined sheet. Bake in a 400�F (204�C) for 3 minutes to crisp. After removing from the oven, cover the breads until you are ready to make your pizzas.<\/p><p>Assembly is easy. Top the muffins with sauce, mozzarella cheese (vegan or dairy), and assorted toppings. Return muffins to the baking sheet and place in a 400�F (204�C) oven for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted, and the muffins are slightly brown on the edges.<\/p><p>TIP: If you have leftover baked pizzas, you can freeze them on a baking sheet first, and once they�re frozen, store in the freezer until you�re ready to use. For a snack or quick meal, place the frozen English muffin pizzas on a parchment-lined sheet, and bake in a 350�F (191�C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until cheese is melted and bread is warm.<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28872\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Prep\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>French or Italian Bread Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If using French or Italian breads, buy a good quality bread as this will make or break your pizza. Depending on the size of your bread, you should be able to get 4-6 �slices� out of each half. Find a bread that has a soft rather than crispy crust.<\/p><p>Slice the bread in half, length-wise, and store in a bag until ready to use. Each half will become a �team pizza.� This works great with older children who are more adventurous and apt to try new taste combinations and negotiate their pizza experience. Working together also makes the pizza taste better!<\/p><p>Sub sandwich buns also work great as pizza crusts. One per guest should be sufficient, and for children you can start with a half sub each.<\/p><p>Before assembly starts, preheat your oven to 400�F (204�C).<\/p><p>Unlike the English muffins, you don�t have to crisp the crust first. On each half of your bread or bun, spread marinara or pizza sauce. Add toppings and cheese. On the middle rack of your oven, bake the pizza for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the sides of the bread are lightly browned.<\/p><p>Remove from oven. Allow to cool slightly before slicing (if using a whole loaf rather than a bun).<\/p><p><strong>Other Food Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>If your party guests are children, they probably won�t need an elaborate table of foods to choose from. Consider a simple tossed salad, a plate of antipasto (veg of course!), and a bowl of fruit. For dessert, we suggest sorbet, ice cream, or Nice cream.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/nice-cream/).\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27731\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg\" alt=\"Nice-Cream\" width=\"1100\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-300x182.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-768x465.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>Ice cream is a natural pairing to pizza. If you want to continue the do-it-yourself theme, set out a few toppings, from chocolate to sprinkles to fresh fruit.<\/p><p><strong>Party Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>To decorate for your party, remember that Italy�s colors are red, white, and green. You can color small Italian flags or purchase at a party store. Create your own pizzeria by topping your tables with red and white checkered tablecloths�choose vinyl, if you can find them, for easy cleanup. If you can�t find vinyl, check your local fabric store for gingham fabric (usually inexpensive) and select checks that are large.<\/p><p>If you�re going all out, you can add pictures on your wall from Italy like the Leaning Tower of Pizza (oops! Pisa), the Colosseum, canals of Venice, a map of Italy, etc. Hang red, white, and green streamers and dangle a few balloons.<\/p><p>For your guests old and young, have a stack of blank paper or Mona Lisa coloring sheets (easy to print from the Internet) and ask your partiers to create their own contemporary Mona Lisa. What would a Mona Lisa today look like? Would she be a sports fan? a scientist? a musician? a chef?<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28873\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Party\" width=\"1200\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-300x154.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-768x395.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>Games and Movies<\/strong><\/p><p>Movies and pizza seem to go together. A lot of famous movies are set in Italy, but most of them are for older children or adults. However, there are classics that everyone likes: Disney�s Pinocchio, Lady and the Tramp (for the best pasta scene ever), or go rogue and watch the French-inspired Ratatouille (for chefs of all ages). After your meal has finished and the games have been played, pop in a movie while you�re cleaning up.<\/p><p>Some other choices for the older children or adults could be Letters to Juliet, Enchanted April, or a true classic, Roman Holiday. You could even stream an Italian opera like the fun, happily-ever-after ending, Barber of Seville.<\/p><p>If you�d rather play games, here are some fun, inexpensive party games that should appeal.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3\">https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606\">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/\">https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Fun Pizza Facts<\/strong><\/p><p>(Courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/\">https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/<\/a>)<\/p><ul><li>The first pizza is thought to have been invented in Naples in the early 1500s.<\/li><li>The first documented pizzeria was opened in Naples in the late 1800s.<br />The first pizzeria, Lombardi�s, opened in the United States in New York city in 1905.<\/li><li>Pizza in the US didn�t become popular until after World War II when soldiers stationed in Italy developed a taste for the popular dish and started opening up restaurants back home.<\/li><li>NASA funded and tested a 3D printer that can make pizza for astronauts in space.<\/li><li>3 billion pizzas are sold in the US each year.<\/li><li>In the US, October is National Pizza month!<\/li><\/ul><p>&#8211;by Mary Pomerantz for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">Mary Pomerantz lives in the Chicago area with her husband of fifty years.

There was always a full cookie jar<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and baked goods of every sort. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meals were simple but often filled with fat. Vegetables, when served, were usually tasteless and out of a can. I loved her cooking, but because of it, I was a chubby child and an overweight teenager. Before I graduated from high school, I was able to trim down. This gave me more energy and self-confidence. Later in life, I learned how to cook delicious foods without the fat content associated with �good home<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> cooking.�<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Years later, when I discovered a whole food, plant-based diet�and a way of cooking without oil�I�ve been able to control my weight successfully while also increasing my health and stamina. In this blog, I�m going to provide tips for oil-free baking, roasting, saut�ing, and flavoring. It�s easier than you think, and once you learn these tips, you will be able to make your favorite recipes and reduce the fat content substantially. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The reason for reducing oil in our diet has everything to do with health. Linda Scotti is a nurse and educator with an expertise in nutrition. She�s also a regular blogger and member of the Veggie Fest team who will explain the science behind this cooking and health strategy. She says,<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Oil is a processed food. All oils, including olive oil, are extremely low in nutritive value. All the nutrients�including protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water�have been stripped away. Oil is nothing but fat � empty calories. It has more calories per gram than any other food. One tablespoon of oil contains 120 pure fat calories. Since oil has no fat-binding fibers, it�s absorbed rapidly and stored away as body fat within minutes. Several scientific studies have demonstrated that oil is harmful to the endothelium (the innermost lining of the arteries) and that injury is the gateway to vascular disease. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/h5><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn has demonstrated that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent and stop the progression of heart disease, but also reverse its effects. In his book, <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">, Dr. Esselstyn documents his 20-year nutritional study with scientific evidence. Esselstyn is quick to point out that scientific evidence indicates consumption of processed oils (whether monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, or saturated) contribute to obesity and diabetes, increased triglycerides, endothelial dysfunction/impairment and atherosclerotic lesions.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Robert Vogel at the University of Maryland reported in the <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Journal of the American College of Cardiology<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> that olive oil was found to reduce flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by 31% after consumption. Flow-mediated dilation is a non-invasive vascular test which measures blood vessel health. The endothelium releases vasodilators, including nitric oxide, which cause dilation in healthy arteries and keep the blood flowing smoothly. A decrease <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">in FMD is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. In simple terms, the olive oil may impair your arteries ability to relax and dilate normally.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cooking and Baking Without Oils<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are used to adding oil and fats in your cooking and baking, you might think nothing will taste good without it. While your baked product will definitely taste different, it can still be tasty. It took me a lot of years and a lot of reading to uncover the tricks for making food cooked without oil to be just as delicious. I hope you will use these tips to try cooking and baking without oil in your home.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/oatmeal-muffins-with-variations/\">Oatmeal Muffins<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This muffin recipe uses pureed, crushed, or mashed fruit to replace the oil and add sweetness.

Start with a good quality non-stick skillet. Prep your vegetables and then preheat your skillet on a medium high heat. When your pan is hot, add the onions. You need to watch as they cook, but you don�t need to stir constantly. After a few seconds, the vegetables will release moisture. After a few more seconds, they will start to brown. This is the step where the onions need to be carefully watched to prevent them from overbrowning. At some point, if they start to stick to the pan, just add a tablespoon of veggie broth or water and stir it around. After about a minute and a half, turn the onions down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often. If they start to stick, add a little more liquid. Cook until they reach a nice caramelized state.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are adding mushrooms, after about two minutes of cooking the onions, add the mushrooms to the skillet. They release even more moisture so that you may not need to add any extra liquid. Continue to cook at the higher heat until the mushrooms begin to brown. At this point, turn the heat down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often, adding a little liquid as needed. Sometimes, the mushrooms release more moisture than you want in your recipe. No problem, just take the lid off and turn the heat back up to medium high. Stir until all the moisture has evaporated.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You will be happy with this method of saut�ing vegetables. It works for more than just onions and mushrooms. You can use this technique to make a dish of saut�ed cabbage or pan roasted Brussels sprouts or even asparagus. The trick is to start with a hot, dry skillet and stir until your vegetables just start to brown. This releases the sugars in the vegetables and adds so much flavor to whatever recipe you are making.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roasting Vegetables<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes, you will want to roast vegetables like Brussels sprouts or root vegetables. You can still leave off the oil with good results. For dense vegetables like potatoes, it helps to parboil them before you roast them. For instance, when I make oven fries, I cut them in the shape I want, cover them with water and bring the pot to a boil. As soon as the water boils, I turn the heat off, drain the potatoes and put them in the oven on a baking sheet or roasting pan lined with parchment paper to keep the vegetables from sticking.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another tip that helps get a nice crisp to a vegetable is to use a parchment lined pizza pan with holes in it. Cook the vegetables for half the time that you normally would, remove the parchment paper and leave the vegetables on the pan. The holes help to give the vegetables a nice crisp finish. Start out at a moderate temperature, 350�F, and during the last two or three minutes, turn up the oven to 450�F to finish to the crisp stage. Check the vegetables slightly before the time when you think they might be done. The cooking time may be reduced if you use this type of pan.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\">Lentil Millet Sweet Potato Plant-based Burger<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-24734\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg\" alt=\"Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-768x433.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/a><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Judicious Use of Flavorings<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When you are eliminating oil from your diet and possibly even eliminating or at least reducing your sodium intake, you have to add flavorings to your recipes to fool your taste buds into not missing the fat and sodium they are used to. There are two things that help you do this. One is adding something sweet and the other is adding something tart. Citrus fruit is wonderful because it can add both flavors with one squeeze. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fruit in salad <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often add whole fruits to a salad, for instance, because it really perks up the flavor of the dish. Think pineapple chunks, orange slices, and crisp apple slices. In the summer, you can even grill peaches or nectarines and add them to your salad or add a handful of strawberries or raspberries for that real summertime flavor boost.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Steaming vegetables <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here�s how I prepare most side dishes of vegetables so that I never miss the butter or oil. I start by steaming either fresh, raw vegetables or a bag of quality frozen vegetables. You need to learn the correct times for steaming and with a little and trial and error, you will become a pro. Start with a pan of boiling water, about 2 inches in depth. Once the water is boiling, add the vegetables to a steamer basket and place it over the pan. If the vegetables are fresh, they will only probably only take 1-3 minutes to become tender. If they are frozen, the time is about doubled or a little more. Just watch them to ensure they don�t overcook because you can end up with mushy vegetables rather quickly.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once the vegetables are tender, take the steamer basket out, and set it on a hot pad or trivet. To the warm pan over medium heat, add about a tablespoon of low sodium soy or tamari sauce with a teaspoon of minced garlic and about a half tablespoon of a good quality balsamic vinegar. Stir for about a minute to cook the garlic. Add the steamed vegetables, toss and serve. If you don�t want to use the balsamic, you could add a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon to the steamed vegetables and toss it in the warmed soy sauce and garlic mixture. Also, before you toss the vegetables, you can add the herbs of your choice such as basil, tarragon, Italian seasoning, etc.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Balsamic Vinegars <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are many good flavored balsamic vinegars on the market. They can be expensive, but they can really add to the flavor of a meal. I love to go into a balsamic boutique shop <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to sample the flavors. Citrus flavored vinegars add a sweet tart note to salads or vegetables. Chocolate or vanilla vinegars are great over fresh or poached fruit for desserts. Try a few different flavors for an incredible taste treat!<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Citrus <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A squeeze of either an orange or a lemon can perk up many dishes from beans to stir fries. When I started cooking without oil and lower sodium, I started thinking about the flavors that I like and played with different seasonings. Don�t be afraid to try something. Just remember that with some flavors, a little goes a long way. Try a little seasoning, taste, and adjust by adding a little more until you get the dish just the way you want. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking Without Fat<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking without adding fat is a little trickier. Some recipes seem to have no problems when you substitute other things for the oil or butter. To me it�s always worth a try to experiment with favorite recipes to see what works. I�ve made cookies, cakes, and quick breads that are tasty without the addition of oil. They are usually moister and less fluffy than pastries and breads made with oil, but they are equally as good and a lot healthier. The one pastry that I have never been able to come up with is a traditional pie crust that is usually made with vegetable shortening or butter. If you want a pie, you will have to find recipes that typically use nuts and dates that will hold together and make a suitable base for your pie fillings.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For substitutions in your baking try using <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><ul><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">unsweetened applesauce or mashed bananas to replace oil or butter and <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">prune puree to replace butter. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another substitute you can use to replace oil or butter is ground flax seed.

In terms of health, a whole food, vegan, plant-based diet can significantly reduce the risk of nearly all major chronic illnesses. Additionally, new research has concluded that a vegan diet produces a 42-84 percent lower burden on the environment than the diet recommended by the U.S. government. Lastly, adopting a vegan diet can save more than 30,000,000 cows, 100,000,000 pigs, 500,000 calves, one trillion fish, and many more animals from being slaughtered in just one year.<\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27160\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">Although veganism has increased in popularity over the past few years, there has also been skepticism claiming that a vegan diet is more costly than a meat-based one. Unfortunately, due to an increased demand from vegan consumers, some companies began making and selling dairy-free products at a higher cost than those containing dairy. Because these companies were so successful, many more began doing the same. In no time, these inflated prices became the norm. Thus, giving the impression that the vegan diet was more pricey than other diets.  <\/span><\/p><p>Although, transitioning to a vegan diet can be more costly�at least initially�it doesn�t have to be. When I first turned vegan, I spent a lot of money because I purchased brand items. However, as I became more familiar with what products were vegan, I began cooking more meals from scratch and learned which brands would be long-lasting and nutritious. Through my own transition period, I realized that living on a vegan diet can be less expensive than a meat-based one. Here are some ways I was able to bust the myth.<br /><b><\/b><\/p><h2>How a Vegan Diet can be Inexpensive<\/h2><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">The main components of a vegan diet are grains, legumes, beans, and seeds, which are very affordable. Whole plant foods contain all the essential nutrients your body needs and are also the cheapest foods out there. Transitioning to a vegan diet can include trying many of the superfoods in the market, which can be more expensive, but these pricier foods are not necessary to incorporate in every meal. Creating a balanced, nutritious vegan meal is both affordable and fun. <\/span><\/p><p>Some quick tips when grocery shopping include buying items in bulk�such as flour, grains, nuts/seeds, etc.�because these foods will not spoil quickly. It is also helpful to buy generic brand items rather than name-brand items, as they will satiate your hunger just as easily, but at a cheaper price! Taking some time to explore different grocery stores in your area and comparing prices can be really useful for future grocery trips. Noting down where each item is located and bringing those notes with you each time you go shopping will not only help you save on costs, but also on time.<\/p><p>Time and cost can also be saved by making a grocery list beforehand within your specific budget so that no foods are purchased unnecessarily. Stocking up on whole foods is another way to cut back on costs since a small portion of whole foods can keep you full longer than other sugary or carbohydrate-rich foods taken in larger portions. Buy frozen fruits and vegetables, as they can be cheaper and contain the same, if not higher, nutritional value as fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"> Eat whole grain cereal for breakfast; hummus served with lettuce in whole wheat pita bread for lunch; a vegetable stir-fry with beans, greens, and brown rice for dinner; and a fruit smoothie for a snack or dessert at a grand total of $2.25 for a full day of plant-based meals. Another example of a meal-plan would be to serve for breakfast a tofu scramble and whole-grain flour tortilla; bean tacos for lunch; soup with beans and collards for dinner; and an apple crisp as a snack or for dessert which altogether costs $4.00 total. There are many other meal plans such as these that only cost $4.00 or less a day, saving money in the long run. <\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27158\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-768x438.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><h2>Long-term Savings from a Vegan Diet<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><\/span><\/h2><p>Not only can you count the cost of food when going vegan, but you can also calculate the money saved on doctors� bills. Eating poorly ultimately results in illness whereas eating healthily can keep you out of the doctor�s office. It is easy to get wrapped up in the short-term savings mindset, such as purchasing food that is unwholesome just because it�s a dollar cheaper than a healthier choice. However, spending a few extra dollars at the grocery store or farmer�s market may actually save you thousands of dollars in potential doctors and hospital visits.<\/p><p>Just in case you think I�m exaggerating, take a look at this sobering statistic: In a study done in 1992, the total direct medical costs linked to meat consumption was between 28.6 and 61.4 billion dollars. Direct healthcare costs attributable to meat consumption can be broken down in this way: $2.8 &#8211; 8.5 billion for hypertension, 9.5 billion for heart disease, 16.5 billion for cancer, 14 &#8211; 17 billion for diabetes, 2.4 billion for gallbladder disease, 1.9 billion for obesity-related musculoskeletal disorders, and 5.5 billion for foodborne illness. Not only have these prices increased since 1992, but healthcare costs have inflated, as well.<\/p><p>At first, the standard American diet (SAD)�which involves a lot of fast food, processed food, sugar, and fatty meats�may seem inexpensive when evaluating dairy and meat items side-by-side with vegan substitutes.  However, when considering that animal-based foods are linked to cancer, the cost of the vegan diet seems nominal.<\/p><p>It�s also important to note that animals farmed by the food industry are themselves given hormones to make them larger and more profitable. Ultimately, these hormones enter into the bodies of those who consume the products and by-products. For example, dairy cattle are given hormones to make them produce more milk; other animals are given food filled with pesticides and herbicides. These poisons�that have been stored in the fat and muscles� ultimately find their way into meat, milk and eggs. Mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are commonly found in fish and shellfish, and can negatively affect reproductive and hormone functions in human beings.<\/p><p>A plant-based diet can help avoid all of these toxic chemicals from entering the body. There is another added benefit for substituting a meat or dairy item with a vegan alternative: By substituting beans for meat, your daily fiber consumption increases by twenty grams. This is a signficant way to tackle the possibility of colon cancer.<\/p><p>Overall, transitioning to a vegan diet is an inexpensive choice, both for the short-term and long-term. Not only is veganism helpful for the environment, our health, and protecting animals, but it also cuts down on our time and expenses. More and more people are turning vegan.
