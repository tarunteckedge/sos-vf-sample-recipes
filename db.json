Your favorite plant-based toppings from mushrooms and peppers to vegan �pepperoni� or �ham!� It�s especially popular with kids, because pizza can be picked up and eaten with fingers and hands. Not surprisingly, an international poll rated pizza as one of the top three favorite foods in the world.<\/p><p>Since finding awesome ways to celebrate defines both Veggie Fest and our fans, let�s talk pizza AND a party!<\/p><p>First steps to planning a fun night is to identify your crowd. Are you planning for your immediate household or extended family? Are you inviting neighbors or old friends? Once you�ve decided on your audience, go little or go big. Any pizza party involves three things: making pizza, playing games, and having fun. Even in your pajamas!<\/p><p>Getting your kids to participate from the get-go is essential. With a little prep work, even young kids can assemble a pizza, wait for it to bake, and . . eat!<\/p><p>Decide first whether you want to go all-out by making dough and the marinara sauce from scratch. If so, we�ve got you covered.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/marinara-sauce/\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27545\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Marinara-Sauce-W\" width=\"1100\" height=\"733\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Piizza-Marinara-Sauce-W-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>If it�s a Friday night after work, you can also simplify by using a pre-made crust or dough, English muffins, naan, French or Italian bread.<\/p><p>Arranging the ingredients before your kids�or guests�arrive, guarantees a seamless celebration. Make your dough and sauce ahead of time or set out your prepared �crusts.� Chop the veggies and arrange in separate containers along with your toppings and cheeses (vegan or dairy). Set your ingredients in the middle of a large table, and leave the perimeter for your pizza-making chefs. Add a bit of pizazz by changing the atmosphere with music. The best part of a pizza party is the conversation and community you�re creating in your kitchen. You don�t have to over plan, either. Make sure you�re relaxed and participating, too. All hands on deck!<\/p><p><strong>Homemade Pizza Dough<\/strong><\/p><p>There is nothing better than a made-from-scratch pizza. Homemade dough and marinara sauce bring your meal to a whole new level. It tastes so much better than store-bought. All it takes is a bit of practice . . .<\/p><p>When using freshly made dough for your pizza party, you can prepare it ahead of time and refrigerate. Make the dough and let it rise for 45 minutes, cover, and refrigerate. About 2-3 hours before you are ready to assemble your pizzas, remove the dough and let it sit, covered, on your counter. Just before your guests arrive, divide the dough into balls about the size of a fist. Cover and let rest.<\/p><p>When ready to assemble the pizzas, let the children shape their own crusts and place them on the oiled or parchment-lined baking sheets. They may have as much fun with the shapes they create as with the toppings they choose. Once shaped, crimp or fold the edges. Follow the directions in the recipe for assembling and baking.<\/p><p>Try our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/traditional-new-york-style-pizza-crust/\">traditional pizza crust<\/a> or our <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/whole-wheat-pizza-crust/\">Whole Wheat Pizza Crust<\/a>. <\/p><p><strong>English Muffin Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If you choose English muffins for your base, buy enough so each guest can have one whole muffin (and maybe another for seconds). Shortly before your guests arrive, split the muffins and place them on a parchment-lined sheet. Bake in a 400�F (204�C) for 3 minutes to crisp. After removing from the oven, cover the breads until you are ready to make your pizzas.<\/p><p>Assembly is easy. Top the muffins with sauce, mozzarella cheese (vegan or dairy), and assorted toppings. Return muffins to the baking sheet and place in a 400�F (204�C) oven for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted, and the muffins are slightly brown on the edges.<\/p><p>TIP: If you have leftover baked pizzas, you can freeze them on a baking sheet first, and once they�re frozen, store in the freezer until you�re ready to use. For a snack or quick meal, place the frozen English muffin pizzas on a parchment-lined sheet, and bake in a 350�F (191�C) oven for 10-12 minutes or until cheese is melted and bread is warm.<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28872\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Prep\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Prep-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>French or Italian Bread Pizzas<\/strong><\/p><p>If using French or Italian breads, buy a good quality bread as this will make or break your pizza. Depending on the size of your bread, you should be able to get 4-6 �slices� out of each half. Find a bread that has a soft rather than crispy crust.<\/p><p>Slice the bread in half, length-wise, and store in a bag until ready to use. Each half will become a �team pizza.� This works great with older children who are more adventurous and apt to try new taste combinations and negotiate their pizza experience. Working together also makes the pizza taste better!<\/p><p>Sub sandwich buns also work great as pizza crusts. One per guest should be sufficient, and for children you can start with a half sub each.<\/p><p>Before assembly starts, preheat your oven to 400�F (204�C).<\/p><p>Unlike the English muffins, you don�t have to crisp the crust first. On each half of your bread or bun, spread marinara or pizza sauce. Add toppings and cheese. On the middle rack of your oven, bake the pizza for 10 minutes or until the cheese is melted and the sides of the bread are lightly browned.<\/p><p>Remove from oven. Allow to cool slightly before slicing (if using a whole loaf rather than a bun).<\/p><p><strong>Other Food Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>If your party guests are children, they probably won�t need an elaborate table of foods to choose from. Consider a simple tossed salad, a plate of antipasto (veg of course!), and a bowl of fruit. For dessert, we suggest sorbet, ice cream, or Nice cream.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/nice-cream/).\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-27731\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg\" alt=\"Nice-Cream\" width=\"1100\" height=\"666\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream.jpg 1100w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-300x182.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-1024x620.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Nice-Cream-768x465.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>Ice cream is a natural pairing to pizza. If you want to continue the do-it-yourself theme, set out a few toppings, from chocolate to sprinkles to fresh fruit.<\/p><p><strong>Party Ideas<\/strong><\/p><p>To decorate for your party, remember that Italy�s colors are red, white, and green. You can color small Italian flags or purchase at a party store. Create your own pizzeria by topping your tables with red and white checkered tablecloths�choose vinyl, if you can find them, for easy cleanup. If you can�t find vinyl, check your local fabric store for gingham fabric (usually inexpensive) and select checks that are large.<\/p><p>If you�re going all out, you can add pictures on your wall from Italy like the Leaning Tower of Pizza (oops! Pisa), the Colosseum, canals of Venice, a map of Italy, etc. Hang red, white, and green streamers and dangle a few balloons.<\/p><p>For your guests old and young, have a stack of blank paper or Mona Lisa coloring sheets (easy to print from the Internet) and ask your partiers to create their own contemporary Mona Lisa. What would a Mona Lisa today look like? Would she be a sports fan? a scientist? a musician? a chef?<\/p><p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28873\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg\" alt=\"Pizza-Party\" width=\"1200\" height=\"617\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party.jpg 1200w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-300x154.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pizza-Party-768x395.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><\/p><p><strong>Games and Movies<\/strong><\/p><p>Movies and pizza seem to go together. A lot of famous movies are set in Italy, but most of them are for older children or adults. However, there are classics that everyone likes: Disney�s Pinocchio, Lady and the Tramp (for the best pasta scene ever), or go rogue and watch the French-inspired Ratatouille (for chefs of all ages). After your meal has finished and the games have been played, pop in a movie while you�re cleaning up.<\/p><p>Some other choices for the older children or adults could be Letters to Juliet, Enchanted April, or a true classic, Roman Holiday. You could even stream an Italian opera like the fun, happily-ever-after ending, Barber of Seville.<\/p><p>If you�d rather play games, here are some fun, inexpensive party games that should appeal.<\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3\">https://www.etsy.com/listing/741609221/pizza-bingo-printable-pizza-bingo-cards?ref=landingpage_similar_listing_top-3<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606\">https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/All-About-Italy-Word-Search-2399606<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/\">https://quizzykid.com/quiz/fun-facts-about-italy-quiz/<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Fun Pizza Facts<\/strong><\/p><p>(Courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/\">https://www.eatthis.com/pizza-facts/<\/a>)<\/p><ul><li>The first pizza is thought to have been invented in Naples in the early 1500s.<\/li><li>The first documented pizzeria was opened in Naples in the late 1800s.<br />The first pizzeria, Lombardi�s, opened in the United States in New York city in 1905.<\/li><li>Pizza in the US didn�t become popular until after World War II when soldiers stationed in Italy developed a taste for the popular dish and started opening up restaurants back home.<\/li><li>NASA funded and tested a 3D printer that can make pizza for astronauts in space.<\/li><li>3 billion pizzas are sold in the US each year.<\/li><li>In the US, October is National Pizza month!<\/li><\/ul><p>&#8211;by Mary Pomerantz for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p><em data-rich-text-format-boundary=\"true\">Mary Pomerantz lives in the Chicago area with her husband of fifty years.

There was always a full cookie jar<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and baked goods of every sort. <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Meals were simple but often filled with fat. Vegetables, when served, were usually tasteless and out of a can. I loved her cooking, but because of it, I was a chubby child and an overweight teenager. Before I graduated from high school, I was able to trim down. This gave me more energy and self-confidence. Later in life, I learned how to cook delicious foods without the fat content associated with �good home<\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> cooking.�<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Years later, when I discovered a whole food, plant-based diet�and a way of cooking without oil�I�ve been able to control my weight successfully while also increasing my health and stamina. In this blog, I�m going to provide tips for oil-free baking, roasting, saut�ing, and flavoring. It�s easier than you think, and once you learn these tips, you will be able to make your favorite recipes and reduce the fat content substantially. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The reason for reducing oil in our diet has everything to do with health. Linda Scotti is a nurse and educator with an expertise in nutrition. She�s also a regular blogger and member of the Veggie Fest team who will explain the science behind this cooking and health strategy. She says,<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><h5 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Oil is a processed food. All oils, including olive oil, are extremely low in nutritive value. All the nutrients�including protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water�have been stripped away. Oil is nothing but fat � empty calories. It has more calories per gram than any other food. One tablespoon of oil contains 120 pure fat calories. Since oil has no fat-binding fibers, it�s absorbed rapidly and stored away as body fat within minutes. Several scientific studies have demonstrated that oil is harmful to the endothelium (the innermost lining of the arteries) and that injury is the gateway to vascular disease. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/h5><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn has demonstrated that a plant-based, oil-free diet can not only prevent and stop the progression of heart disease, but also reverse its effects. In his book, <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Prevent &amp; Reverse Heart Disease<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\">, Dr. Esselstyn documents his 20-year nutritional study with scientific evidence. Esselstyn is quick to point out that scientific evidence indicates consumption of processed oils (whether monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, or saturated) contribute to obesity and diabetes, increased triglycerides, endothelial dysfunction/impairment and atherosclerotic lesions.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Robert Vogel at the University of Maryland reported in the <\/span><i><span data-contrast=\"none\">Journal of the American College of Cardiology<\/span><\/i><span data-contrast=\"none\"> that olive oil was found to reduce flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by 31% after consumption. Flow-mediated dilation is a non-invasive vascular test which measures blood vessel health. The endothelium releases vasodilators, including nitric oxide, which cause dilation in healthy arteries and keep the blood flowing smoothly. A decrease <\/span><span data-contrast=\"none\">in FMD is a predictor of cardiovascular disease. In simple terms, the olive oil may impair your arteries ability to relax and dilate normally.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cooking and Baking Without Oils<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are used to adding oil and fats in your cooking and baking, you might think nothing will taste good without it. While your baked product will definitely taste different, it can still be tasty. It took me a lot of years and a lot of reading to uncover the tricks for making food cooked without oil to be just as delicious. I hope you will use these tips to try cooking and baking without oil in your home.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/oatmeal-muffins-with-variations/\">Oatmeal Muffins<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/a><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This muffin recipe uses pureed, crushed, or mashed fruit to replace the oil and add sweetness.

Start with a good quality non-stick skillet. Prep your vegetables and then preheat your skillet on a medium high heat. When your pan is hot, add the onions. You need to watch as they cook, but you don�t need to stir constantly. After a few seconds, the vegetables will release moisture. After a few more seconds, they will start to brown. This is the step where the onions need to be carefully watched to prevent them from overbrowning. At some point, if they start to stick to the pan, just add a tablespoon of veggie broth or water and stir it around. After about a minute and a half, turn the onions down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often. If they start to stick, add a little more liquid. Cook until they reach a nice caramelized state.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you are adding mushrooms, after about two minutes of cooking the onions, add the mushrooms to the skillet. They release even more moisture so that you may not need to add any extra liquid. Continue to cook at the higher heat until the mushrooms begin to brown. At this point, turn the heat down to low medium and put a lid on the skillet, continuing to stir often, adding a little liquid as needed. Sometimes, the mushrooms release more moisture than you want in your recipe. No problem, just take the lid off and turn the heat back up to medium high. Stir until all the moisture has evaporated.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You will be happy with this method of saut�ing vegetables. It works for more than just onions and mushrooms. You can use this technique to make a dish of saut�ed cabbage or pan roasted Brussels sprouts or even asparagus. The trick is to start with a hot, dry skillet and stir until your vegetables just start to brown. This releases the sugars in the vegetables and adds so much flavor to whatever recipe you are making.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Roasting Vegetables<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes, you will want to roast vegetables like Brussels sprouts or root vegetables. You can still leave off the oil with good results. For dense vegetables like potatoes, it helps to parboil them before you roast them. For instance, when I make oven fries, I cut them in the shape I want, cover them with water and bring the pot to a boil. As soon as the water boils, I turn the heat off, drain the potatoes and put them in the oven on a baking sheet or roasting pan lined with parchment paper to keep the vegetables from sticking.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another tip that helps get a nice crisp to a vegetable is to use a parchment lined pizza pan with holes in it. Cook the vegetables for half the time that you normally would, remove the parchment paper and leave the vegetables on the pan. The holes help to give the vegetables a nice crisp finish. Start out at a moderate temperature, 350�F, and during the last two or three minutes, turn up the oven to 450�F to finish to the crisp stage. Check the vegetables slightly before the time when you think they might be done. The cooking time may be reduced if you use this type of pan.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p class=\"elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default\"><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\">Lentil Millet Sweet Potato Plant-based Burger<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/lentil-millet-sweet-potato-plant-based-burger/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-24734\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg\" alt=\"Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-1024x577.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1-768x433.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Lentil-Millet-Sweet-Potato-Plant-based-Burger-1.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/a><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The Judicious Use of Flavorings<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When you are eliminating oil from your diet and possibly even eliminating or at least reducing your sodium intake, you have to add flavorings to your recipes to fool your taste buds into not missing the fat and sodium they are used to. There are two things that help you do this. One is adding something sweet and the other is adding something tart. Citrus fruit is wonderful because it can add both flavors with one squeeze. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fruit in salad <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">I often add whole fruits to a salad, for instance, because it really perks up the flavor of the dish. Think pineapple chunks, orange slices, and crisp apple slices. In the summer, you can even grill peaches or nectarines and add them to your salad or add a handful of strawberries or raspberries for that real summertime flavor boost.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Steaming vegetables <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Here�s how I prepare most side dishes of vegetables so that I never miss the butter or oil. I start by steaming either fresh, raw vegetables or a bag of quality frozen vegetables. You need to learn the correct times for steaming and with a little and trial and error, you will become a pro. Start with a pan of boiling water, about 2 inches in depth. Once the water is boiling, add the vegetables to a steamer basket and place it over the pan. If the vegetables are fresh, they will only probably only take 1-3 minutes to become tender. If they are frozen, the time is about doubled or a little more. Just watch them to ensure they don�t overcook because you can end up with mushy vegetables rather quickly.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Once the vegetables are tender, take the steamer basket out, and set it on a hot pad or trivet. To the warm pan over medium heat, add about a tablespoon of low sodium soy or tamari sauce with a teaspoon of minced garlic and about a half tablespoon of a good quality balsamic vinegar. Stir for about a minute to cook the garlic. Add the steamed vegetables, toss and serve. If you don�t want to use the balsamic, you could add a tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon to the steamed vegetables and toss it in the warmed soy sauce and garlic mixture. Also, before you toss the vegetables, you can add the herbs of your choice such as basil, tarragon, Italian seasoning, etc.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Balsamic Vinegars <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are many good flavored balsamic vinegars on the market. They can be expensive, but they can really add to the flavor of a meal. I love to go into a balsamic boutique shop <\/span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to sample the flavors. Citrus flavored vinegars add a sweet tart note to salads or vegetables. Chocolate or vanilla vinegars are great over fresh or poached fruit for desserts. Try a few different flavors for an incredible taste treat!<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Citrus <\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A squeeze of either an orange or a lemon can perk up many dishes from beans to stir fries. When I started cooking without oil and lower sodium, I started thinking about the flavors that I like and played with different seasonings. Don�t be afraid to try something. Just remember that with some flavors, a little goes a long way. Try a little seasoning, taste, and adjust by adding a little more until you get the dish just the way you want. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking Without Fat<\/span><\/b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Baking without adding fat is a little trickier. Some recipes seem to have no problems when you substitute other things for the oil or butter. To me it�s always worth a try to experiment with favorite recipes to see what works. I�ve made cookies, cakes, and quick breads that are tasty without the addition of oil. They are usually moister and less fluffy than pastries and breads made with oil, but they are equally as good and a lot healthier. The one pastry that I have never been able to come up with is a traditional pie crust that is usually made with vegetable shortening or butter. If you want a pie, you will have to find recipes that typically use nuts and dates that will hold together and make a suitable base for your pie fillings.<\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For substitutions in your baking try using <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/p><ul><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">unsweetened applesauce or mashed bananas to replace oil or butter and <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">prune puree to replace butter. <\/span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"><\/span><\/li><li data-leveltext=\"?\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"1\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another substitute you can use to replace oil or butter is ground flax seed.

In terms of health, a whole food, vegan, plant-based diet can significantly reduce the risk of nearly all major chronic illnesses. Additionally, new research has concluded that a vegan diet produces a 42-84 percent lower burden on the environment than the diet recommended by the U.S. government. Lastly, adopting a vegan diet can save more than 30,000,000 cows, 100,000,000 pigs, 500,000 calves, one trillion fish, and many more animals from being slaughtered in just one year.<\/p><p><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27160\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">Although veganism has increased in popularity over the past few years, there has also been skepticism claiming that a vegan diet is more costly than a meat-based one. Unfortunately, due to an increased demand from vegan consumers, some companies began making and selling dairy-free products at a higher cost than those containing dairy. Because these companies were so successful, many more began doing the same. In no time, these inflated prices became the norm. Thus, giving the impression that the vegan diet was more pricey than other diets.  <\/span><\/p><p>Although, transitioning to a vegan diet can be more costly�at least initially�it doesn�t have to be. When I first turned vegan, I spent a lot of money because I purchased brand items. However, as I became more familiar with what products were vegan, I began cooking more meals from scratch and learned which brands would be long-lasting and nutritious. Through my own transition period, I realized that living on a vegan diet can be less expensive than a meat-based one. Here are some ways I was able to bust the myth.<br /><b><\/b><\/p><h2>How a Vegan Diet can be Inexpensive<\/h2><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\">The main components of a vegan diet are grains, legumes, beans, and seeds, which are very affordable. Whole plant foods contain all the essential nutrients your body needs and are also the cheapest foods out there. Transitioning to a vegan diet can include trying many of the superfoods in the market, which can be more expensive, but these pricier foods are not necessary to incorporate in every meal. Creating a balanced, nutritious vegan meal is both affordable and fun. <\/span><\/p><p>Some quick tips when grocery shopping include buying items in bulk�such as flour, grains, nuts/seeds, etc.�because these foods will not spoil quickly. It is also helpful to buy generic brand items rather than name-brand items, as they will satiate your hunger just as easily, but at a cheaper price! Taking some time to explore different grocery stores in your area and comparing prices can be really useful for future grocery trips. Noting down where each item is located and bringing those notes with you each time you go shopping will not only help you save on costs, but also on time.<\/p><p>Time and cost can also be saved by making a grocery list beforehand within your specific budget so that no foods are purchased unnecessarily. Stocking up on whole foods is another way to cut back on costs since a small portion of whole foods can keep you full longer than other sugary or carbohydrate-rich foods taken in larger portions. Buy frozen fruits and vegetables, as they can be cheaper and contain the same, if not higher, nutritional value as fresh fruits and vegetables.<\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"> Eat whole grain cereal for breakfast; hummus served with lettuce in whole wheat pita bread for lunch; a vegetable stir-fry with beans, greens, and brown rice for dinner; and a fruit smoothie for a snack or dessert at a grand total of $2.25 for a full day of plant-based meals. Another example of a meal-plan would be to serve for breakfast a tofu scramble and whole-grain flour tortilla; bean tacos for lunch; soup with beans and collards for dinner; and an apple crisp as a snack or for dessert which altogether costs $4.00 total. There are many other meal plans such as these that only cost $4.00 or less a day, saving money in the long run. <\/span><\/p><p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27158\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-1024x585.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2-768x438.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Ashtha2.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/p><h2>Long-term Savings from a Vegan Diet<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}\" data-wac-het=\"1\"><\/span><\/h2><p>Not only can you count the cost of food when going vegan, but you can also calculate the money saved on doctors� bills. Eating poorly ultimately results in illness whereas eating healthily can keep you out of the doctor�s office. It is easy to get wrapped up in the short-term savings mindset, such as purchasing food that is unwholesome just because it�s a dollar cheaper than a healthier choice. However, spending a few extra dollars at the grocery store or farmer�s market may actually save you thousands of dollars in potential doctors and hospital visits.<\/p><p>Just in case you think I�m exaggerating, take a look at this sobering statistic: In a study done in 1992, the total direct medical costs linked to meat consumption was between 28.6 and 61.4 billion dollars. Direct healthcare costs attributable to meat consumption can be broken down in this way: $2.8 &#8211; 8.5 billion for hypertension, 9.5 billion for heart disease, 16.5 billion for cancer, 14 &#8211; 17 billion for diabetes, 2.4 billion for gallbladder disease, 1.9 billion for obesity-related musculoskeletal disorders, and 5.5 billion for foodborne illness. Not only have these prices increased since 1992, but healthcare costs have inflated, as well.<\/p><p>At first, the standard American diet (SAD)�which involves a lot of fast food, processed food, sugar, and fatty meats�may seem inexpensive when evaluating dairy and meat items side-by-side with vegan substitutes.  However, when considering that animal-based foods are linked to cancer, the cost of the vegan diet seems nominal.<\/p><p>It�s also important to note that animals farmed by the food industry are themselves given hormones to make them larger and more profitable. Ultimately, these hormones enter into the bodies of those who consume the products and by-products. For example, dairy cattle are given hormones to make them produce more milk; other animals are given food filled with pesticides and herbicides. These poisons�that have been stored in the fat and muscles� ultimately find their way into meat, milk and eggs. Mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are commonly found in fish and shellfish, and can negatively affect reproductive and hormone functions in human beings.<\/p><p>A plant-based diet can help avoid all of these toxic chemicals from entering the body. There is another added benefit for substituting a meat or dairy item with a vegan alternative: By substituting beans for meat, your daily fiber consumption increases by twenty grams. This is a signficant way to tackle the possibility of colon cancer.<\/p><p>Overall, transitioning to a vegan diet is an inexpensive choice, both for the short-term and long-term. Not only is veganism helpful for the environment, our health, and protecting animals, but it also cuts down on our time and expenses. More and more people are turning vegan.

She was a year younger than me, which means I was the instigator. I always did love fresh baked cookies! We sat down at the kitchen table and poured over Mom�s cookbook to find a recipe. I can still remember the name of that cookie, chosen (no doubt) by the way the name rolled off of our tongues�snickerdoodle!<\/p><p>For those of you who are not familiar with this cookie,snickerdoodles are crisp, sugary, and redolent with cinnamon. My memories of the event are hazy. After all, it was over fifty years ago! As I recall, we made a nice mess in the kitchen and the cookies were delicious. My mom didn�t mind turning me loose in the kitchen after this success as long as I cleaned up!<\/p><p>I was raised as the oldest daughter in a large family of seven children. My mom had her hands full, and I was expected to help out in the kitchen at a very early age. It was no chore for me because I loved putting meals together. At first, I only helped by fetching ingredients, opening cans, and stirring pots. I gradually learned from my mother, and by the time I was fourteen, I was cooking meals for the family. This is how Istarted a life-long culinary adventure.<\/p><p><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27386\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-300x194.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3-768x495.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids3.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/span><\/p><p>Over the years, I�ve enjoyed exploring different cuisines. I own many ethnic cookbooks and subscribe to numerous cooking blogs. What studying different techniques and ingredients has taught me is to be creative and fearless�to take chances. It�s freeing to have the confidence to create your own dishes because you realize that you have learned so much from a lifetime of study. My favorite way of cooking is to use lots of herbs and spices. Lately, I�ve been on an Italian kick which means using a lot of Italian seasoning, garlic, and basil.<\/p><p>Children love cooking with their mom or dad�whoever is the chef in the family. Just as I learned at an early age, I also taught all of my children, and to this day they are all wonderful�if different�kinds of cooks. My son, Brian, who lives in Idaho, ishis family�s main chef. He has three sons. Frey, who is fourteen, has also caught the cooking bug. When my husband and I visited them recently, Frey made a few of the meals and did an excellent job. I was amazed watching him wield a knife to cut up assorted vegetables to make a Thai inspired skillet meal. He even made a coconut/peanut sauce to go with the vegetables and tofu. It was delicious! I expect great things from him in the future.<\/p><p>While Brian excels at simple, mostly one-pot meals, my son Chris, who lives in California, is the gourmet chef in the family. Because he lives in the San Francisco Bay area and has a myriad of vegan restaurants to choose from, his tastes lean more to the exotic. Often when he cooks at home, he likes to make sophisticated recipes like cr�pes with homemade hazelnut butter, vegan cream fillings, all topped with strawberries and drizzled chocolate. He also created a vegan Pad Thai that is as good as any dish I�ve eaten in a restaurant.<\/p><p>My daughter was a comfort food cook. She loved making spaghetti, lasagna, and enchiladas for her family. She also loved carrying on the family traditions that she learned while growing up. For instance, at Christmas time, I liked to cook for days before the actual holiday so that I could rest and enjoy my family instead of spending my time working in the kitchen. I always set up a feast of finger foods and dips in the early afternoon, and we enjoyed it for the rest of the day. I know she instilled this tradition in her children because her son, Max, called me this last Christmas asking for my cheese ball and rolled sugar cookie recipes. My daughter is no longer with us, but the family tradition continues on with the love of cooking that she instilled in her son!<\/p><p><span class=\"s4\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-27387\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/kids4.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/span><\/span><\/p><h2>Getting started<\/h2><p>Begin with simple tasks and move gradually onto more complicated ones as your children gain confidence and their skills mature.<\/p><ul><li>When your children are very young, start them out by washing vegetables or fruit at the sink. Fill the sink with water, give them a soft brush, and let them work away. Even if you plan to peel the produce, it still needs to be washed prior to peeling.<br />\nAnother job they can do is place ingredients into a bowl. You measure, they dump. Just make sure you are using a big, wide bowl to lessen chances of spillage.<\/li><li>Once your children reach seven or eight years, they should be able to open cans for you and empty the cans into a pot or bowl. You can supervise the process, but allow them to do the work. Once the ingredients are in the bowl or the pot, they can stir them together.<\/li><li>When they are older, they can even stir a pot on the stove. Place a stepstool up to the stove, and place the heat on a low flame. Of course, a lesson about the dangers of hot burners and boiling pots can precede the cooking time. If a child knows that you trust them to be careful, they will want to do a good job for you.<\/li><\/ul><h2><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"bumpedFont15\">Creative Cookies<\/span><\/span><\/h2><p><a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/cutout-sugar-cookies-for-the-holidays/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26001\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-1024x586.jpg\" alt=\"Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-300x172.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-768x439.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/a><\/p><p>There are many recipes you and your children can make together that give them more scope and creativity.

Let them have a hand in selecting the recipe and even shopping for the ingredients. The more independence we teach our children, the better prepared they are to face life on their own. If they know that you trust them, it will bring them great joy. Like Maria Montessori has said :<\/p><p class=\"s10\"><em>�Joy, feeling one&#8217;s own value, being appreciated and loved by others, feeling useful and capable of production are all factors of enormous value for the human soul.�<\/em><\/p><p>Most important, bringing kids into the kitchen is a way for everyone to have fun!<\/p><p>Cooking does not have to be a chore. Instead, it can be a highly satisfying and enjoyable activity.<\/p><p>Because the Veggie Fest team is convinced there is a budding chef in most kids, we will make this topic a recurring theme in blogs to come. We hope you enjoy them!<\/p><p><em>Mary Pomerantz lives in the Chicago area with her husband of fifty years. Together, they have been vegetarian since 1969 and raised their three children as vegetarians. Mary has always been a foodie and enjoys cooking, researching recipes, and reading cookbooks and food blogs. She has been involved with Veggie Fest since its inception, with over 11 years coordinating the food demos.<\/em><\/p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/kids-in-the-kitchen/\">Why Cooking with Your Kids is a Good Idea<\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org\">Veggie Fest<\/a>.<\/p>"

      "encoded": "<p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">It�s still deep winter in Northern Michigan as I am writing this. An expanse of white stretches outside, punctuated by dozens of blue jays that swoop down to pick up sunflower seeds and peanuts from the feeders, outlining blue and white feather arabesques as they fly away. And I dream of spring.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">I bring out the old metal box with my seeds from last year: the ones that were left over and the ones I preserved myself. I still have many seeds, and I am making mental lists of what seeds to order from the glossy seed catalogs that arrive in the mail. Their pictures of beautiful vegetables and fruits, herbs and leaves present a subliminal message, enticing me to put this and that variety on my shopping list.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">It�s still too early to start most seedlings in pots in my sunroom, but in a few weeks, I will start several varieties of peppers and eggplant. When I return from my trip to India in late March, I will start the tomatoes and the brassica family. That will also be the time to clean the little old greenhouse from the walnut-hull debris that the squirrels have left behind. I will start using it in April to help harden the seedlings that will have sprouted by then. That�s the time I will also start cucumbers and my annual flowers: marigolds, zinnia, and calendula, right in the greenhouse. And then, 25 garden beds will need to be turned over and \\ covered with compost. I will consult last year�s map of the garden and chart this year�s planting. By the time May comes around, the greenhouse will be bursting with plants to be transplanted in the garden beds.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><\/p><h2>GETTING READY FOR THE SPRING GARDEN<\/h2><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> If this is the first time you are planning a garden, it�s good to start early and to start small. The steps below will give you an understanding of what a garden plot involves, but you do not have to follow them implicitly. You can skip several steps and even buy plants ready to be put in the soil in May or June, but starting seeds yourself is part of the fun.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> February: Decide what you would like to plant this year. Make an outline on paper of your garden spot and figure out what will go where. If you are ambitious and you want to give your plants a little boost, study companion planting for more successful gardening. Some plants love to cozy up to each other, while others might emit substances that are not beneficial to their neighbors. A good old book to consult is Carrots Love Tomatoes, by Louise Riotte. Borrow it from your library and go directly to the chart at the end listing which plants like each other.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">At this stage, it might be a pleasure to dream about five varieties of tomato plants, but try to be realistic. See what would grow well in your area, in your soil, in your garden plot. Most varieties of plants can grow in northern climates�either in the spring or in the fall. Consult the seed companies� catalogs and make a list of seeds to order. Try to find companies that are located in your hardiness zone; this will make sure your plants will thrive in your climate.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>March<\/strong>: Once you have a good idea of what you will plant, and you have your seeds in hand, find out how many days it takes for your specific varieties to be ready for harvest. Then, start your seeds accordingly. For example, eggplant needs a long growing season. In northern Michigan, we have a shorter season for their liking, so I have to start the seeds in early March. The same thing holds true for peppers. Since pepper seeds take a long time to germinate (2-3 weeks) I start them at the same time as the eggplant.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In my sunroom, I bring in an old rickety table just for the seedlings. I cover it with a plastic sheet and put my seed trays and individual pots right on the plastic.  After filling the containers with organic composted earth, I seed the pots, water them and cover with a thin layer of clear plastic to keep the moisture in. That way, I do not need to water every day. As soon as the little heads start popping out, I remove the clear plastic cover. If your windows are not true south-facing, you might want to invest in some growing lights or simple heat lamps. You can find them online or in feed stores. They will maintain an even heat/light for these sensitive seedlings.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>April<\/strong>: This is the time to start other plants that need a long season: tomatoes, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, okra, basil. They get the same treatment that the eggplant and peppers did. Just remember that basil is very cold sensitive. Make sure it is always in a warm, sunny place. If you have a greenhouse or some cold frames, get them ready so that you may install your seedlings there, as the temperatures get warmer. The brassica family plants are the first to get into the greenhouse, as they are hardier than the other plants. I start the annual flowers and the cucumbers right in the greenhouse, but I still baby the basil and keep it in the house.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">As soon as all the snow is gone, and I can turn over the earth in the garden beds, I plant lettuce, carrots, spinach, parsley, swiss chard, collards, and other plants that like the cold soil.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">By now, the garlic that I planted in one bed in October has popped up and it is the first green in the garden. I use the first fronds to spice up my cooking.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>May<\/strong>: By now, you can start to fill the greenhouse with any vegetable that needs a little extra time. If you do not have a greenhouse, you can take your plants outside on the deck to harden them. You can always bring them back in if the weather turns unexpectedly cold. Depending in which zone you live, you might start transplanting your plants directly in the soil. I usually do not take any chances and finish the garden in June.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>June<\/strong>: As the weather warms up, the greenhouse is full of plants eager to be out in their permanent home. It takes a few days to empty the greenhouse, so I start with the hardiest ones and then continue with the ones that love warmth the most. I try to finish most of the garden by the first week of June, except for one or two beds that I leave empty for successive planting. I wait a few weeks between seeding several varieties of lettuce, carrots, and spinach, and they get in the ground in June and July. That way I have lettuce and a variety of greens throughout the summer.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/SpringG4-1024x419.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"419\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">And the season will change into full summer, with the garden greening, ripening, producing, and offering its magic: dirt under the fingernails; color in the garden; greens on our plates; a palette of tastes in our cooking, and a deep satisfaction that comes from enjoying the growing foods that the garden yields.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> Well, I am ahead of myself.

It was at Angelica�s Kitchen, a vegetarian restaurant in New York City. It has been over twenty years since then, and communal tables in restaurants are now a regular site. Back then, it was a novelty for me and a wonderful experience to eat a meal and chat with fellow diners.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> I grew up in Ireland where friendliness was the national currency and communal dining usually included a huge pot of �spuds� set on the table, cooked in their jackets. From early on it was clear to me that dining together can be a wonderful human experience. Just through sharing a meal, we can build a healthier physical, social, and emotional fabric for ourselves and our communities.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> I love the idea that preparing and eating food can become a moment for reflection and gratitude, a sacred act. To break bread together reminds us how to love by nurturing. When I first went to visit my in-laws in India, I quickly learned the Telegu for �have you eaten?� because I was asked so often. Instead of asking,  �How are you?� they would ask �Tinnavaa?? I also discovered I could give great delight to my hosts just by requesting seconds. Food has the universal power to bring people together.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> So . . . in this time of social distancing, it might be unusual to write a blog about communal eating, but who knows? Maybe we will need an extra dose of humanity and togetherness after this is all over. It might be a joyous celebration and a healing experience to eat together again, sitting face-to-face, putting away devices and distractions, and remembering that conversations are the real currency of our everyday lives. For now, we are hunkered down, staying six feet away from each other, and maybe longing for crowded trains and eating at long tables with strangers!<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> The Japanese know a lot about eating together, and they have wonderful words that illustrate the benefits. Nabemono �things-in-a-pot� is a communal one-pot meal. The intimate communal experience is called nabe o kakomu or �surrounding a pot.� The deeper meaning is described as Ichi-go ichi-e, &#8220;once in a lifetime,&#8221; otherwise known as a cultural concept of treasuring the unrepeatable nature of a moment. They even have a special pot called a donabe (doh-NAH-bay) that has been in use for over one thousand years. There is a deep tie between the cooking pot, the ingredients, and the ritual of gathering friends and family around a communal dish?.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thumbnail_290320_4965-copy-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> So what is a donabe? Well, it is an earthenware pot that comes in different sizes and shapes.? Some donabe are made specifically for cooking rice, such as the double-lid pot called a kamado-san. A donabe is intended for cooking over a flame. It retains heat because of its thick clay walls. Food remains warm and can keep cooking in the residual heat. The donabe can go straight from stove to table and is both practical and beautiful. ?Rice cooked in a donabe tastes better, and a donabe is ideal for slow stews and soups.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> The nabemono is a one pot meal that is cooked on a portable stove in the center of the table, and the pot is filled with broth and ingredients like, vegetables, seaweed, tofu, and udon. Nabemono is meant to be eaten as a communal meal, where diners sit around the table and pick items directly from the pot. There are many different variations of nabemono. Broths can be as simple as water flavored with a little bit of dried kelp, to stronger tastes made with vegetarian stock or miso. ?A basic recipe can be built on just a few ingredients, such as tofu, mushrooms and dashi (Japanese cooking stock) or other quick and easy broths. With just some daikon, green onion, sliced tofu, and chili sauce, an easy shabu-shabu dish is just a few minutes away.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">?A donabe needs to be seasoned before it can be used. Also, special care is taken with maintenance, cleaning, and storing.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/thumbnail_033120310320_50121033120-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"543\" height=\"481\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">?Donabe recipes can easily be adapted to vegetarian versions. If you find yourself needing a reason to linger longer together, just bring out the donabe and try the recipe below. This might be the perfect antidote to fractured modern living, and a reminder about what is most important in life�caring for each other, intimacy, and connection. So, when we do finally get the chance to celebrate and eat together,? let�s make it a wonderful act of gratitude for the simple things we still have.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"> &#8211;Joanna Nagubadi for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><em> Joanna Nagubadi grew up in Ireland and now lives in Illinois with her husband and two children.

      "encoded": "<p>I became a vegetarian 43 years ago, choosing a lacto-vegetarian diet that eschewed meat, fish, fowl, eggs and their derivatives, but I still consumed dairy products. It was an easy, compassionate lifestyle that suited me well.<\/p><p>Since then, I have moved to the countryside of northern Michigan, and have a large vegetable garden that provides my husband and me with veggies, fruits, and berries. In addition, the variety of wild things growing in the area is astounding. I can supplement my diet with vibrant greens and mushrooms that abound in the woods behind our house. Slipping down to the stream in early spring to collect watercress, dandelion shoots, and cattails, or walking the woods in May and September for morels and chanterelles, are enjoyable activities for me.<\/p><p>When I decided to become vegan three years ago, I found that I missed the taste and function of butter and cheese. I tried the store-bought varieties, and they filled the gap. After all, there is an amazing array of products available, but I was never entirely satisfied. After almost two years of finding substitutes for milk products, I began to think of making my own cheeses.<\/p><p>A year ago, I started viewing several YouTube tutorials. The precise cheese-formulating process became clearer, so I armed myself with a variety of cheese-making cookbooks, several special ingredients, and took a leap.<\/p><p>I started with one of the easiest cheeses to make, namely a replica of feta, the <a href=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/mediterranean-herbed-feta-from-the-non-dairy-evolution-cookbook-by-chef-skye-the-gentle-chef/\">Mediterranean Herbed Feta<\/a>. After all, I grew up in Greece and was missing the taste of feta in my homemade Greek salads.<\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-22170\" src=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blog-Feta-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blog-Feta-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blog-Feta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blog-Feta-768x512.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Blog-Feta.jpg 1025w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p>There are many hits-and-misses in making cheese, but I was lucky because that first attempt was a success. That�s when I was hooked. I saw how easy it is to make cheese at home, so I ventured with other over-the-stove cheeses: Smoked Gouda, Mozzarella, Provolone, and Swiss. Then, I branched out to cultured and aged nut cheeses like Blue Cheese, Sharp Cheddar, and Brie. Finally, I started to create butter, yogurt, and mayonnaise.<\/p><p>The beauty of the process is that even if I make mistakes (omit an ingredient, or cook with too high or low heat, etc.) and the final product is not exactly what I was hoping for, the cheese can still be salvaged in a different form. I can make a cheese sauce out of it, or use it to stuff ravioli, or simply pour it over steamed veggies.<\/p><p>Making cheese at home is easy�really easy! Nevertheless, since there are special ingredients that you will need, my advice to you is to prepare ahead. Order online and have all the ingredients on the countertop: not just in front of you, but measured out in their own little bowls.<\/p><p>This gathering of ingredients is called �mise en place.� This detail is important, because some components have to be introduced first, and some at the end of the cheese-making process.<\/p><p>There is an alchemy that takes place in making cheese�any kind of cheese�and to see and taste the final product is very rewarding.<\/p><p>With some quiet time and the willingness to experiment, you are all set. You will need a cookbook to start with, or you can watch YouTube videos. The cookbooks I recommend are, Non-Dairy Evolution Cookbook: A Modernist Culinary Approach to Plant-Based, Dairy Free Foods (NDE) by Skye Michael Conroy; This Cheese is Nuts: Delicious Vegan Cheese at Home by Julie Piatt; and Artisan Vegan Cheese by Miyoko Schinner. They cover the array of cheeses you want to start with. NDE has the best detailed instructions for success. There are several pages of in-depth, step-by-step instructions, which are invaluable in the beginning. I suggest you read and reread the instructions in order to familiarize yourself with the process.<\/p><p>The main ingredient of the cheeses can be soy and/or almond milk, or a variety of nut milks. If you are soy or nut intolerant, there are recipes for steamed rice-, oat-, or sunflower seed- cheeses. Your imagination is the limit.<\/p><p>If you are transitioning to the vegan lifestyle and you miss some flavors and tastes from your earlier non-vegan life, making cheese at home is affordable, easy, and very satisfying. Sometimes, I still buy vegan cheese from the store, just to compare the taste and to investigate what ingredients are used, but I always return to making vegan cheese at home.

      "encoded": "<p>A few days ago, we had our first hard frost in Northern Michigan�a little late in the season and very welcome to a gardener. The following day, I went out to put the garden to rest. With my wheelbarrow nearby, I started going from raised bed to raised bed, methodically pulling out the limp remains of the frosted plants. I started with the beans, proceeded to the three tomato beds, and then pulled out the basil, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, and the squash. I paused at the two beds full of annual, bee-loving flowers, sorry to see the once colorful part of the garden dimmed and frozen.<\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-25953\" src=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Winter3-1024x350.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Winter3-1024x350.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Winter3-300x102.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Winter3-768x262.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Winter3.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p>The memory of this area of the garden brings me back to my childhood. I grew up on the outskirts of Athens, Greece, on a piece of land that I remember fondly. At least five acres in size, it abounded with fruit trees: apricot trees, mulberries, figs and cherries. The little path leading to the neighbors� house was planted with grape vines, replete with hedgehogs who spent their shy lives in the small culverts that spanned the path. The area in between held rows and rows of prickly artichoke plants. The flowers of the artichokes resemble giant thistles piercing the air above the fanning leaves. Our neighbors� chickens raised their chicks under the bristly leaves.<\/p><p>My mother was an amazing gardener. She preferred flowers and herbs over vegetables, and her gigantic white roses were the envy of the neighborhood. She minded her garden every day, squirreling away precious water to tend her flowers. In the arid months of the summer, her garden blossomed. I think that my love for gardening dates to that time.<\/p><p>Our neighbors grew lilac bushes all along the front of the yard, and in the spring the fragrance wafted our way. Along with the eucalyptus trees on the other side of the road, the air was always scented with something blooming. Mine was an active childhood spent entirely outdoors; we only came inside to sleep.<\/p><p>Returning to the task at hand, I set my wheelbarrow down and stretch my back. Getting ready for winter is physical work. It demands bending, pulling hard, shaking the roots, placing the once vibrant plants into the wheelbarrow and making several trips to the compost pile. Most of the 25 beds I tended over the summer are now ready for next year�s planting.<\/p><p>The fun, however, isn�t entirely over. My fall vegetables are taking precedence right now. The cabbage, cauliflower, Swiss chard, and beets will stay in the ground for several more weeks, as will the arugula and some of the lettuce. Kale stays in also, and I harvest it as needed. I prefer to pick the beets in late fall, although it�s a crop that can overwinter, also. Carrots take the prize because they develop such sweetness with the colder temperatures and are a staple in our home, eaten raw or cooked.<\/p><p>Fall temperatures make these hardy vegetables taste crunchy and sweet, and they can be harvested throughout the fall and winter months. Living in the Zone 5 Hardiness Zone, I need to be aware of the limits of my little plants. Looking out for protection, I always apply some sort of cover over the plants that will stay in for the winter. Depending on the acidity of the soil that the plants love, I can cover with leaves, sawdust, pine needles, or straw.<\/p><p>Garlic: My forty plus garlic heads were harvested in early September, so now is the time to plant the crop for next year. The individual cloves will stay in the ground for almost a year. I prepared one of the beds, and, choosing 12 garlic heads from this year�s harvest, I planted the individual cloves several inches apart. They will stay snug under the earth with the coming snow. The garlic greens are the first to pop up in the spring, and the tops can be harvested sparingly. I use them to spice up our salads along with the wild leeks that grow on the hillside by the house.<\/p><p>Multiplying Onions: One of the most prolific crops in a kitchen garden is the versatile multiplying onion. Like its name suggests, it is very easy to grow because it propagates itself with no help from the gardener. Left alone, it grows little bulbs on slender heads, which late in the season bend down, touch the ground, develop roots, and voil�, several little onions emerge. Multiplying onion greens are good in salads, and the small heads go well with potatoes and peas, or in vegan omelets. Try this <a href=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/multiplier-onion-pesto/\">Multiplier Onion Pesto<\/a>: You can substitute with the more common green onions. Both are rich in thiamine as well as Vitamins C, B2, A, and Vitamin K. The fresh flavors of this pesto will elevate any salad, pizza, or pasta dish and will have you dreaming of summer.<\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-25948\" src=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Webp.net-compress-image-1024x822.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Webp.net-compress-image-1024x822.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Webp.net-compress-image-300x240.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Webp.net-compress-image-768x616.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Webp.net-compress-image.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p>Cabbage and Cauliflower: I typically plant the cruciferous plants together, sprinkled with marigolds for pest control. Since this time of the year the marigolds have been removed, there is more space for the cabbage and the cauliflower. I remove outer, wilted leaves of the cabbage and cover the plants with a thin layer of leaves. Since the cauliflower will not last much longer unprotected, I harvest that first and leave the cabbage for later.<\/p><p>Swiss Chard, Kale, and Arugula: These are good crops that last through most of the winter. Swiss Chard, with its glossy, ruby-veined leaves can take much cold and still yield a nice crop. It is a biennial and will produce flowers and seeds the following year. If protected with straw and/or leaves, I can harvest it for several weeks after a hard frost. Kale and arugula will do well on their own, and they get crisper as the cold increases. I use Swiss chard, to supplement the spinach in my vegan spinach pies.<img class=\"size-full wp-image-25964\" src=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1.jpg\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1.jpg 1080w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/img_0255-1-700x700.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /><\/p><p>Carrots: A favorite winter crop in my garden, carrots stay in the ground all winter long covered up by leaves or straw. It is a rare pleasure to walk out to the garden in the winter, shovel off a foot or two of snow, remove the straw, and get down to the carrots that have remained in the ground during the winter months. In the cold, they produce more sugars (nature�s antifreeze) and are extremely sweet. <a href=\"http://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/moms-autumn-carrot-and-squash-soup/\">Mom&#8217;s Autumn Carrot and Squash Soup<\/a>, both creamy and savory,&nbsp; will keep you cozy through the autumn and winter months.<\/p><p>My root cellar (pantry) abounds with colorful produce harvested the past month: garlic and onions in their baskets, squash in rows on every available surface; tomatoes collected green and ripening in newspaper; canned pickles on the shelves, and apples in bushel baskets. Gardening, even in small spaces, is enjoyable and bountiful. A small area behind the house that is sunny can yield a bumper crop of veggies. The easiest way is to start now, before the snow comes. After deciding what the best area is, start covering it with one or two layers of clean, heavy cardboard. You can cover the cardboard with leaves that you�ve raked from your yard. Come spring, you can fabricate a bed around the space you covered using non-treated wood, buy several bags of organic soil, and you are ready to plant. Try tomatoes, lettuce, swiss chard, arugula, onions, zucchini. Or plant any vegetable you like. Start small and enjoy the bountiful harvest and the spring-in-your-step that a garden can give you.<\/p><p>-Lizzie Treefon for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p><em>Lizzie Treefon arrived in the USA from her native Greece more than 40 years ago.

Most of us know how much excitement is poured into Christmas and New Year�s Day, but there are other holidays celebrated around the world at this time. Because Veggie Fest draws an international attendance�and because our website is now fully translated into Spanish for our friends and family south of the border�we wanted to highlight a few of the most anticipated winter celebrations.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Hanukkah<\/strong> or the Festival of Lights (<a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/hanukkah-and-latkes-around-the-world/\">see our blog on this holiday)<\/a> is observed for eight days throughout the world by people of the Jewish faith. It commemorates �the rededication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem� in which a lamp burned for eight days without oil This miracle was extremely important in the history of the Jewish people and has been commemorated ever since. One candle on a menorah is lit each night of the eight-day holiday Families gather together, play games, exchange gifts, and eat special foods, many of which are fried.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In some parts of Europe, <strong>St. Nicholas Day<\/strong> is celebrated on December 6, the anniversary of his death. St. Nicholas was a Catholic saint who was said to be very kind and compassionate to those in need. He gave all his time and resources to care for the poor, especially children. It is thought that the legend of Santa Claus was inspired by the story of St. Nicholas. The day is celebrated in some countries with parades, festivals, feasts, and of course, gift-giving.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>The Winter Solstice<\/strong> is a holiday that has been celebrated by people from around the world. It occurs on the shortest day of the year, between December 20th and December 23rd in the northern hemisphere. Traditionally, celebrations have included burning bonfires and lighting candles. As it is dark much of the day during Winter Solstice, it was once thought that lighting a fire would encourage the sun to reappear. Festivals are held in different parts of the world that include dancing, singing, and special foods. A good explanation of how the Winter Solstice has been celebrated can be found on this <a href=\"https://hraf.yale.edu/winter-solstice-celebrations-around-the-world/\">Yale University site<\/a><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Christmas Day<\/strong> commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. It is celebrated in different ways by different people. For some, it is a high holy day and is marked by church services and the reading of scriptures that tell the story of the first Christmas. For others who are not religious and sometimes not even Christians, it is a holiday for merriment and gift-giving.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/WinterHoliday-1024x402.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"402\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In the US and other countries, homes are decorated with lights, fresh trees, evergreen boughs, mistletoe and holly leaves. Families and friends gather to eat special foods and sing traditional songs. It is a reason to dress up and have parties to celebrate the season. Traditionally, it is also a time of generosity. People look for charitable foundations to donate food and clothing to those in need.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Children look forward to Christmas because it means that they might receive toys or costly items that they could not ask for at other times of the year. In some countries, the tradition of Santa Claus�that merry old gentleman dressed in red and white fur�is thought to bring gifts and place them beneath an evergreen tree during the night to be discovered by children in the morning.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">I remember when I was a child the stories of Santa Claus charmed me. I would sit on my bed looking out the frosty window, hoping to catch site of him. Of course, I would fall asleep, but magically in the morning, the space beneath the tree that was devoid of gifts when I went to bed, would be filled with brightly covered packages. The belief in the merry man only endured for a short time, but it was magical while it lasted.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>Kwanzaa<\/strong> has roots in ancient African festivals for successful harvests. It is celebrated by African-Americans and people in other countries from December 26 to January 1 with decorations of fruits and vegetables and dressing in traditional African clothes. It culminates in exchanging gifts and eating special foods.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kwanzaa-1024x672.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" /><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">The holiday was advanced by Dr. Maulana Karenga in 1966 to celebrate community unity and family values.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\"><strong>New Year�s Day<\/strong> recognizes the end of the old year and fresh beginnings in the new year. People often celebrate with New Year�s Eve parties, wearing special clothes, dancing, and eating party foods. At the end of the evening at midnight, when the new year begins, fireworks are often lit to celebrate. In the southern United States, it is traditional to eat black-eyed peas for good luck.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">On New Year�s Day people often reflect on the old year and make resolutions to do better in the new year. It is a time for optimism and looking ahead. People often make plans to eat healthy foods, spend more time exercising, and donate time to charitable initiatives.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">In some parts of the world, the Christmas season is celebrated for twelve days, culminating on January 6, which is called the Epiphany or Three Kings Day. In the Christian faith, it is believed that three kings from the East came to pay homage to the baby Jesus. This event is celebrated by people all over the world. Some children get their gifts on this day rather than on Christmas Day.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">One theme that permeates all of these winter holidays is that of friendship and fellowship. People are often more relaxed and friendlier to those they meet. They laugh and smile more. During this time, people reach out to those less fortunate. Clothes and toys are donated. Food is collected and distributed. People look for reasons to suspend disagreements and build bridges of understanding.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Let us carry this feeling of love with us throughout the year, never forgetting the gifts that we have been given, and continuing to look for reasons to share. Let�s extend the giving beyond family and friends into the community to those in need.<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">If you are celebrating any of these holidays, you may want to consider these special recipes:<\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Enjoy our hot, spiced cider, Wassail, which is a seasonal favorite.  <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/wassail/\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Wassail-Juice.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" /><\/a><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">You can turn your kitchen into a fun, creative space for the whole family with our recipe for buttery and crisp vegan sugar cookies. <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/cutout-sugar-cookies-for-the-holidays/\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Sugar-Cut-Cookies-WB-1-1024x586.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"586\" /><\/a><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">Our easy and tasty Candied Pecans make delicious snacks and great gifts.  <a href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/recipe/candied-pecans/\"><img src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Candied-Pecans-w.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"585\" /><\/a><\/p><p data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\" data-darkreader-inline-color=\"\">&#8211;Mary Pomerantz for the Veggie Fest Team<\/p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/celebrating-the-winter-holidays/\">Celebrating the Winter Holidays <\/a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org\">Veggie Fest<\/a>.<\/p>"

      "encoded": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many Americans, I have a family history of heart or cardiovascular disease. Growing up in a small town in northern Wisconsin with a dentist father who hunted and fished, we ate meat or fish daily. We didn�t have a TV until I was ten years old, so I was a bookworm. The public library was only two short blocks away, so I�d walk there even when it was below zero, which was common during the winter. That fueled my interest in other parts of the world.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I was in college living in a dorm, eating meat no longer appealed to me. I worked at a restaurant in Madison that featured fresh vegetarian soups and offered some vegetarian entr�es. Without even thinking about it, my meat consumption declined. During my senior year, I spent Easter weekend with my aunt and uncle who were caring for my grandfather. I ate Easter ham three meals in a row. It felt like I had a brick inside my gut! After that, I never ate red meat again, much to my German grandmother�s dismay.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My husband, Kevin, and I met as Peace Corps volunteers in Paraguay. It was so surprising to learn that he was also vegetarian! That�s where I grew to love beans and rice. After the Peace Corps, I went to nursing school in DC, where I became lacto-vegetarian (vegetarians who eat dairy). Since I�m from Wisconsin, on most days I ate an ounce of cheese (never Velveeta or processed � that�s not real cheese!). Kevin got a job overseas in Burkina Faso, a former French colony in Western Africa. We shipped over several ten-pound bags of dried beans (since most people ate meat there, if they could afford it). Our oldest son was born in Minneapolis. We took him to Burkina Faso when he was only four weeks old. He met my German grandmother when he was eight months old. I think that she stopped worrying about me after that, because she saw how healthy he was. We also lived in Guatemala, Rhode Island (where our middle son was born), and India (where our youngest son was born). Throughout three pregnancies, including nursing each of them until they were over a year old, I was lacto-vegetarian. Unfortunately, my German grandmother died at 87 years old of a heart attack, so she never met our youngest two sons.<\/span><\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26538\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2-HealthyHeart-1024x533.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2-HealthyHeart-1024x533.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2-HealthyHeart-300x156.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2-HealthyHeart-768x400.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2-HealthyHeart.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because different members of my family have dealt with CVD or cardiovascular disease, I became passionate about learning more in an effort to understand how I could avoid it and how I could help those I love. It�s sobering to read the statistics and to see members of my extended family develop CVD.<\/span><\/p><p><b>Heart Disease is Largely Preventable<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardiovascular disease includes high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart attack/myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. CVD is the leading cause of death in the US, accounting for 1 in every 4 deaths and a death every 37 seconds. Forty-eight percent of all adult Americans have CVD. This is a huge public and personal health problem for many of us.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heart disease is also a significant cause of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia in the United States. Growing evidence links high blood pressure and CVD with Alzheimer�s disease: �Heart disease as well as cardiovascular risk factors, particularly if they manifest in midlife, are associated with the eventual development of dementia later in life� <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Journal of Clinical Epidemiology <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(2013: 5, 135-145). This makes sense as the brain is a very sensitive organ. Brain cells begin to die within several minutes without oxygen or glucose. What is good for the heart is also good for the brain!<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that 80% of all CVD can be prevented. Isn�t this exciting? This can encourage and empower us to adopt a healthy lifestyle to dramatically reduce our risk of developing CVD.&nbsp; Interestingly, the way to avoid it or reverse it is to eat more vegetables and exercise moderately for half an hour at least five days a week. The new science of epigenetics studies how our internal and external environments act to turn on and off genes. Our diet and toxins are some of the influencers governing how our DNA is expressed. As Dr. Mark Menolascino has said, �Your genes are your potential, not your destiny.�&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat or prevent CVD, we can start with the American Heart Association�s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simple 7 Guidelines<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manage Blood Pressure<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Control Cholesterol<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce Blood Sugar<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Active<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eat Better<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lose Weight<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop Smoking<\/span><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These directives assume that most of us are overweight, which is true. As of 2018, almost 40% of Americans were obese and over 70% overweight. It also is a recognition that as one ages while eating the Standard American Diet (SAD) and living a sedentary lifestyle, development of CVD is very likely. We see this same pattern of increased obesity and CVD in countries that have adopted a Western lifestyle and diet.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we get to the point where we have to act on those seven guidelines to prevent a health crisis, we can reduce our risk of obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar by switching to a plant-based, whole food diet (PBWF) and exercising almost daily. As Dr. T. Colin Campbell explains in his very informative book, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whole: Rethinking the Science of Nutrition<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, our bodies have evolved with metabolic pathways that are very complex and depend on thousands of plant phytonutrients or phytochemicals. He and many other doctors consider nutrition to be the cornerstone of our health.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26539\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-HealthyHeart-1024x705.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"705\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-HealthyHeart-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-HealthyHeart-300x207.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-HealthyHeart-768x529.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/4-HealthyHeart.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p><b>Green Leafy Vegetables are the Greatest<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ounce for ounce, calorie for calorie, vegetables are the most nutritionally dense foods that we can eat. They have all the vitamins and minerals that we need, including phytonutrients that are not available in supplements or any single �superfood.� Some vegetables, especially green leafy ones, contain nitric oxide, which is a vasodilator and helps maintain good cardiovascular health. The 1998 Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to researchers who discovered its important role in the body. A well-balanced PBWF diet will give us all the nutrients that we need (except Vitamin B-12):&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6-11 servings of fruits and vegetables) including<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2 serving of green leafy and 1 serving of cruciferous vegetables<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 servings of whole grains&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 servings of legumes or beans&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1 serving of nuts or seeds.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><\/ul><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A serving is usually 1/2 c. of food, but check the USDA MyPlate guidelines for more information. What�s so special about vegetables? They have a lot of fiber, which the average American doesn�t eat enough of, and special phytonutrients like anthocyanins, carotenoids, anthoxanthins, and chlorophyll. These are essential for optimal bodily function. They also include a higher percentage of the vitamins and minerals that are listed on food labels than any other food group. Fruits are another good source of vitamins, fiber, and some minerals, but they are not as nutritionally dense as vegetables.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><b>Whole Grains and Whole Foods for Holistic Health<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whole grains were found to reduce high blood pressure as well as medication in a randomized, controlled trial. <\/span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685951\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20685951<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are no adverse effects to using food, rather than drugs, for improved health. There are other benefits to eating more whole grains including more regular bowel habits, as well as a lower risk of CVD, colon cancer, weight gain, and Type 2 diabetes. Carbohydrates are essential for our body to function. Whole grains are the best source of carbohydrates, which are broken down into glucose (the fuel for every cell in our body).&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How amazing is this<b>!<\/b> The only diet that has been shown to reverse coronary heart disease (CHD) is a PBWF diet. Nathan Pritikin, although not an M.D., was very smart and curious. He did his own research after being diagnosed with CHD at age 42 and became a vegetarian. After eradicating all signs of CHD, he started treating end-stage CHD clients with a mainly PBWF diet and exercise in the 60�s. Dr. Dean Ornish reversed atherosclerosis with the same lifestyle tools. The only three centers approved by Medicare for intensive cardiac rehabilitation (ICR) are the Pritikin ICR, the Ornish ICR, and the Bensen-Henry Institute in Boston. A panel of nutrition experts at US News and World Report ranked the Ornish diet as the most heart-healthy one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-26540\" src=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-HealthyHeart-1024x596.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"596\" srcset=\"https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-HealthyHeart-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-HealthyHeart-300x175.jpg 300w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-HealthyHeart-768x447.jpg 768w, https://veggiefestchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/3-HealthyHeart.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><\/p><p><b>Nine Steps towards Heart Health<\/b><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you�re not ready to switch to a PBWF diet, there are several steps that you can take now to improve your health and nutrition:&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><ol><li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"><ol><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Stop drinking soda, even diet sodas.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp; The Cleveland Clinic says that diet soda consumption is associated with weight gain and can trick the brain and body into craving sweeter foods <\/span><a href=\"https://health.clevelandclinic.org/3-reasons-you-should-kick-your-diet-soda-habit/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://health.clevelandclinic.org/3-reasons-you-should-kick-your-diet-soda-habit/<\/span><\/a><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eat at least one serving of a green, leafy vegetables daily<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the darker, the better: think spinach, collards, kale, mustard greens), and <\/span><b>eat<\/b><b>four servings of cruciferous vegetables<\/b><b>weekly <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, arugula, bok choy, brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, rutabaga, turnips, radish, wasabi).<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Eat less processed foods.<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are high in fat, sodium, phosphates (which negatively affect calcium levels), sugar, additives, and preservatives.&nbsp; Many of these additives and preservatives are generally regarded as safe (GRAS) but their effects on human health haven�t been studied.

BHA and BHT are two common preservatives that are subject to severe restrictions in Europe but are widely used in the U.S.A.

You and your M.D. are partners in the achievement of your personal health and wellbeing. You should feel respected and listened to by your M.D.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Know your blood pressure, LDL, and fasting blood glucose values<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take preventive action when any of these numbers increases because high values predisposes you to developing CVD, as well as Type 2 diabetes.&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Maintain your weight in the normal range<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Develop your own personal nutrition plan that incorporates green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, fruit, legumes and beans, whole grains, nuts, and seeds. Avoid fad diets or those that can�t be sustained for long periods of time, such as the many versions of the low carb, high fat diets (LCHF). Diets that omit processed foods are better than SAD, but that�s a low benchmark for comparison. Many studies that show short-term weight loss with these fad diets are funded by the meat and dairy industries. Long-term studies of LCHF diets show increased mortality, including from CVD.&nbsp; Remember that only a PBWF diet has been shown to reverse heart disease. The experts at <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News and World Report<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranked the Paleo, Keto, and Atkins diet in the bottom 20% of heart-healthy diets.<\/span><\/li><li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Read, research, and apply what you learn about the link between nutrition and health<\/strong>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don�t take it for granted that you will develop CVD if you have a family history of it. Don�t take it for granted that the chronic diseases associated with the Standard American Diet and sedentary lifestyles are inevitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><\/ol><\/li><\/ol><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of these steps can help you reduce your risk of developing cardiovascular disease, the number one killer in our country today. You will feel better both physically and mentally.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although a long-time lacto-vegetarian, I am working my way towards adopting a vegan diet. My husband and sons are all very active vegans, but I�m still a �cheese-head� in some ways. I think conscious change that evolves slowly and naturally is what works for me.
